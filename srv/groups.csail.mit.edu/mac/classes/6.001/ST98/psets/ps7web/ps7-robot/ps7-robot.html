<B>Problem Set 7</B>

<P>
<UL>
<LI> Issued:  Tuesday, March 17
<LI> Tutorial preparation for: Week of March 30
<LI> Written solutions due: Friday, April 3 in recitation
<LI> Reading: Read
      through section 3.3.3 before lecture on Thursday, 19 March.
      Read section 3.5 before lecture on Tuesday, 31 March.
<LI> Code:  The following code (attached) should be studied as part
      of this problem set:
       <UL>
<LI> <TT>objsys.scm</TT>--support for an elementary object system
<LI> <TT>objtypes.scm</TT>--a few nice object classes
<LI> <TT>setup.scm</TT>--a building NE43 (Tech Square) world constructed using these classes
<LI> <TT>search-rooms.scm</TT>--a searching program for a robot in this world
        </UL></UL>
<P>
<B>Word to the wise:</B> This problem set is the most difficult one so
far this semester.  But, perhaps paradoxically, it involves only a
small amount of programming.  The trick lies in knowing <EM>which</EM>
programs to write, and for that, you must understand the attached
code, which is considerable.  You'll need to understand the general
ideas of object-oriented programming and the implementation provided
of an object-oriented programming system (in <TT>objsys.scm</TT>).  Then
you'll need to understand the particular classes (in <TT>
objtypes.scm</TT>) and world (in <TT>setup.scm</TT>) that we've constructed
for you.  Finally, you'll need to review the searching strategy (in
<TT>search-rooms.scm</TT>), which is a variation of the code you used
last week in problem set 6.  In truth, this assignment in much more an
exercise in <EM>reading</EM> and <EM>understanding</EM> code than in writing
code, because reading significant amounts of code is a skill that you
should master if you intend to go on in computer science.  The
tutorial exercises will require you to do considerable digesting of
code before you can start on them.  And we strongly urge you to study
the code before you begin trying the programming exercises themselves.
Diving in starting to program without understanding the code is a good
way to get lost, will virtually guarantee that you'll be spending more
time on this assignment than necessary.

<B>A maze of twisty little passages, all alike</B>

In this problem set we will try to master a powerful strategy for
building simulations possible worlds, as discussed in lecture on March
19.  The strategy will enable us to make modular simulations with
enough flexibility to allow us to expand and elaborate the simulation
as our conception of the world expands and becomes more elaborate.
<P>
One way to organize our thoughts about a possible world is to divide
it up into discrete objects, where each object will have a behavior by
itself, and it will interact with other objects in some lawful way.
If it is useful to decompose a problem in this way then we can
construct a computational world, analogous to the ``real'' world, with a
computational object for each real object.
<P>
Each of our computational objects has some independent local state,
and some rules (or programs) that determine its behavior.  One
computational object may influence another by sending it messages.
The program associated with an object describes how the object reacts
to messages, and how its state changes as a consequence.
<P>
You may have heard about this idea in the guise of ``Object-Oriented
Programming''(OOPs!).  Languages such as C++ and Java are organized
around OOP.  Although OOP is helpful in many circumstances it has been
oversold as a panacea for the software-engineering problem.  What we
will try to understand here is the essence of the idea, rather than
the accidental details of their expression in particular languages.
