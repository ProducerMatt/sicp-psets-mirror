<P>
Our world is built by the <TT>setup</TT> procedure that you will find in
the file <TT>setup.scm</TT>.  You are the deity of this world.  When you
call <TT>setup</TT> with your name, you create the world.  It has rooms,
corridors, and people from building NE43, and it has an avatar (a
manifestation of you, the deity, as a person in the world).  The
avatar is under your control. It goes under your name and is also the
value of the globally-accessible variable <TT>me</TT>.  Each time the
avatar moves, simulated time passes in the world, and the various
other creatures in the world take a time step.  The way this works is
that there is a clock that sends a <TT>clock-tick</TT> message to all
autonomous persons.  (The avatar is not an autonomous person; it is
directly under your control.)  In addition, you can cause time to pass
by explicitly calling the clock.  If the global variable <TT>
*deity-mode*</TT> is true you will see everything that happens in the
world; if <TT>*deity-mode*</TT> is false you will only see things
happening in the same place as the avatar.
<P>
To make it easier to use the simulation we have included a convenience
procedure, <TT>thing-named</TT> for referring to an object at the
location of the avatar.  This procedure is defined at the end of the
file <TT>setup.scm</TT>.
<P>
Here is a sample run of the system.  Rather than describing what's
happening, we'll leave it to you to examine the code that defines the
behavior of this world and interpret what is going on.

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00031000000000000000">The Robot</A></H2>
<P>
We have provided you with an interesting kind of autonomous person, a
robot.  A robot can be created at any place that you have access to.
The robot will sit around, and do nothing in particular, unless it is
given a method to execute on clock ticks.  In the file <TT>
search-rooms.scm</TT> we provide the kernel of a program that will direct
a robot to explore a world, looking for a thing with a given name.  At
the end of the file is an example where the robot is constructed at
the location of the avatar, and it is programmed to look for an object
whose name is <TT>the-goal</TT>.
