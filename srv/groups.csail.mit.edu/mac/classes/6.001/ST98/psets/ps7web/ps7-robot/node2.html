<P>
Another idea that was described in lecture on March 19th is that of
<EM>delegation</EM>, which is the use of one object's method by another
object.  For example, when you read the code in <TT>objtypes.scm</TT>,
you will see definitions of several different kinds of objects.  Among
these are mobile objects (made by <TT>make-mobile-object</TT>) that can
<TT>change-location</TT>, and persons (made by <TT>make-person</TT>).  When
a mobile object moves from one place to another the lists of <TT>
things</TT> at the old location and at the new location must be changed:
The object is removed from the list at the old location and added to
the list at the new location.
<P>
A person is a kind of mobile object.  When a person is constructed, an
internal mobile object is also constructed to handle messages such as
<TT>change-location</TT>.  The mobile object is bound to a variable that
is visible only within the person object.
<P>
When a person moves from one place to another, it does so by using the
<TT>change-location</TT> method from its internal mobile object.
However, it is the person that moves.  Thus, it is the person that
must be added or removed from the lists of things, not the mobile
object from which the method was obtained.  To implement this behavior
the <TT>change-location</TT> method needs to know the actual moving
object, and this is what is passed to the method as <TT>self</TT>.
<P>
This mechanism implements an idea called <EM>delegation</EM>.  Indeed, to
send a message to an object in this system we use <TT>ask</TT>.  For
example, if <TT>me</TT> is an object, named Joe, and we want its name, we
say:
<P>

<PRE>(ask me 'name) ==&gt; Joe</PRE>

<P>
What <TT>ask</TT> does here is get the <TT>name</TT> method from <TT>me</TT>
and then call it with <TT>me</TT> as the argument (so the value of <TT>
me</TT> will be bound to <TT>self</TT> in the method body).  The full <TT>
ask</TT> procedure is defined in the file <TT>objsys.scm</TT>, but here is a
simplified version that works for messages requiring no arguments:
<P>

<PRE>(define (ask object message)
  ((get-method message object) object))

(define (get-method message object)
  (object message))</PRE>

<P>
Sometimes it is necessary to exercise more detailed control over
inheritance.  For example, one kind of character you will encounter in
this problem set is an <TT>avatar</TT>.  The avatar is a kind of person
who must be able to do the sorts of things a person can do, such as
<TT>move-to</TT> a new location.  However, the avatar must be able to
intercept the <TT>move-to</TT> message, to do things that are special to
the avatar, as well as to do what a person does when it receives a
<TT>move-to</TT> message.  This is accomplished by explicit delegation.
The avatar does whatever it has to, and in addition, it delegates to
its internal person the processing of the <TT>move-to</TT> message, with
the avatar as <TT>self</TT>.
<P>
One final note about our system.  If you look in <TT>objtypes.scm</TT>,
you'll see that objects have an <TT>install</TT> method, which does some
appropriate initialization for a newly created object.  For instance,
if you create a new mobile object a at place, the object must be added
to the list of things at the place.  As you'll see in the code, we
define two procedures for each type of object--a maker and a
constructor.  The constructor makes the object and then installs it.
When you create objects in our simulation, you should do this using
the constructor.  Thus, to make a new person, use <TT>
construct-person</TT> rather than calling <TT>make-person</TT> directly.
Also if you decide to extend the simulation by creating new classes
and new kinds of objects, you'll find it convenient to maintain this
discipline of defining separate maker and constructor procedures.
