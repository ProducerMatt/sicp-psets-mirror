<h2 align=center>Quiz 1 announcement</h2>

<h2 align=center>Issued Tuesday, March 3, 1998</h2>


Quiz 1 is on Wednesday, March 11.  The quiz will be held in Walker
Memorial Gymnasium (50-340) from 5--7PM xor 7--9PM.  You may take the
quiz during either one of these two periods, but students taking the
quiz during the first period will not be allowed to leave the room
until the end of the period.  Optional review sessions for the quiz
will be held on Sunday night, March 8, from 7--10 PM in rooms
34-301, 302, 303, and 304.

<p>

The quiz is closed book, but you may bring with you one sheet of notes
that you have prepared to help you study, and also this handout (with
additional notes written on the handout if you like).  The quiz will
cover material presented from the beginning of the semester through
recitation on March 6, the textbook through section 2.5.2, and the
general material covered in the problem sets through problem set 4.


<p>

The quiz will be based on a sample implementation of a system for
housing incoming freshmen in Metropolitan Storage Warehouse.  This
code is available <a href="ps5-code.html">here</a>.

<p>

You should get a copy of the actual handout distributed in
lecture on Tuesday, March 3, and bring a copy of it with you to the quiz.
For students who miss lecture, extra copies may be obtained from the
6.001 course secretary, Rebecca Bisbee in NE43-430.
