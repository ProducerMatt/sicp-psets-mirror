<P>
We won't provide any general explanation of the square-limit
language here, since this is covered in section 2.2.4 of the textbook.
One thing that is not explained in the book, however, is how primitive
painters are implemented (see the book, pages 136-137) and how to
actually use a painter to draw something on the screen.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00021000000000000000">Primitive painters</A></H2>
<P>
The code for this assignment includes four ways to create primitive
painters.
<P>
The simplest painters are created with <TT>number-&gt;painter</TT>, which
takes a number as argument.  These painters fill a frame with a solid
shade of gray.  The number specifies a gray level: 0 is black, 255 is
white, and numbers in between are increasingly lighter shades of
gray.  Here are some examples:
<P>

<PRE>(define black (number-&gt;painter 0))
(define white (number-&gt;painter 255))
(define gray (number-&gt;painter 150))</PRE>

<P>
You can also specify a painter using <TT>procedure-&gt;painter</TT>, which
takes a procedure as argument.  The procedure determines a gray level
(0 to 255) as a function of (<I>x</I>,<I>y</I>) position, for example:
<P>

<PRE>(define vertical-shading
  (procedure-&gt;painter (lambda (x y) (* 255 y))))</PRE>

<P>
The <I>x</I> and <I>y</I> arguments run from 0 to 1 and specify the fraction
that each point is offset from the frame's origin along the frame's
edges.  Thus, the frame is filled out by the set of points (<I>x</I>,<I>y</I>)
such that <IMG WIDTH=89 HEIGHT=25 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline394" SRC="img1.gif">.<A NAME="tex2html3" HREF="footnode.html#270"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://swissnet.ai.mit.edu/latex2html-lib/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A>
<P>
A third kind of painter is created by <TT>segments-&gt;painter</TT>, as
described in the textbook.  This takes a list of line segments as
argument.  This paints the line drawing specified by the list
segments.  For example, the <TT>wave</TT> painter shown in figure 2.10 of
the book is generated by
<P>

<PRE>(define wave
  (segments-&gt;painter
   (list (make-segment (make-vect .25 0) (make-vect .35 .5))
         (make-segment (make-vect .35 .5 ) (make-vect .3 .6))
         (make-segment (make-vect .3 .6) (make-vect .15 .4))
         (make-segment (make-vect .15 .4) (make-vect 0 .65))
         (make-segment (make-vect .4 0) (make-vect .5 .3))
         (make-segment (make-vect .5 .3) (make-vect .6 0))
         (make-segment (make-vect .75 0) (make-vect .6 .45))
         (make-segment (make-vect .6 .45) (make-vect 1 .15))
         (make-segment (make-vect 1 .35) (make-vect .75 .65))
         (make-segment (make-vect .75 .65) (make-vect .6 .65))
         (make-segment (make-vect .6 .65) (make-vect .65 .85))
         (make-segment (make-vect .65 .85) (make-vect .6 1))
         (make-segment (make-vect .4 1) (make-vect .35 .85))
         (make-segment (make-vect .35 .85) (make-vect .4 .65))
         (make-segment (make-vect .4 .65) (make-vect .3 .65))
         (make-segment (make-vect .3 .65) (make-vect .15 .6))
         (make-segment (make-vect .15 .6) (make-vect 0 .85))
         )))</PRE>

<P>
The final way to create a primitive painter is from a stored image.
The procedure <TT>pgm-file-&gt;painter</TT> uses an image from the 6001
image collection to create a painter.<A NAME="tex2html4" HREF="footnode.html#271"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://swissnet.ai.mit.edu/latex2html-lib/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A>
For instance:
<P>

<PRE>(define rogers (pgm-file-&gt;painter &quot;fovnder&quot;))</PRE>

<P>
will create the William Barton Rogers painter shown on page 130 of the
textbook and give it the name <TT>rogers</TT>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00022000000000000000">Drawing on the screen</A></H2>
<P>
When the problem set code is loaded (don't load it yet!), it will
create three graphics windows, named <TT>g1</TT>, <TT>g2</TT>, and <TT>g3</TT>.
To paint a picture in a window, use the procedure <TT>paint</TT>.  <TT>
Paint</TT> takes a graphics window and a painter, determines the frame for
the graphics window, and gives the frame to the painter.  For example,
<P>

<PRE>(paint g1 rogers)</PRE>

<P>
will show a picture of William Barton Rogers in window <TT>g1</TT>.
<P>
There is also a procedure called <TT>paint-hi-res</TT>, which paints the
images at higher resolution (<IMG WIDTH=72 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline402" SRC="img3.gif"> rather than <IMG WIDTH=72 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline400" SRC="img2.gif">).  Painting at a higher resolution produces better looking
images, but takes four times as long.  Depending on how fast your
computer is, you may want to work on this problem viewing images using
<TT>paint</TT>, and reserve <TT>paint-hi-res</TT> to see the details of
images that you find interesting.<A NAME="tex2html5" HREF="footnode.html#272"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://swissnet.ai.mit.edu/latex2html-lib/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A>  When you print images, we suggest that you print only
images created with <TT>paint-hi-res</TT>, not <TT>paint</TT>.<A NAME="tex2html6" HREF="footnode.html#179"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://swissnet.ai.mit.edu/latex2html-lib/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A>
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SECTION00022010000000000000">Computer exercise 1:</A></H4>
 Load the code for problem set 3 using
<TT>M-x load-problem-set</TT>.  Before you can do anything else, you'll
need to define the data representations and operations that you
designed for tutorial exercise 1.  Type in these definitions now, in a
file that will hold all your answers for this problem set, and
evaluate them.
<P>
If these are correct, you should be able to evaluate the expression
<TT>(setup)</TT>.  This will create the three graphics windows and load
the rest of the problem set code, which includes all of the code from
section 2.2.4 of the textbook and the primitive painters <TT>black</TT>,
<TT>white</TT>, <TT>gray</TT>, <TT>vertical-shading</TT>, and <TT>rogers</TT>
described above.  If <TT>setup</TT> works, you should be able to use <TT>
paint</TT> and <TT>paint-hi-res</TT> to view images of the primitive
painters.<A NAME="tex2html7" HREF="footnode.html#273"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://swissnet.ai.mit.edu/latex2html-lib/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A>  If you work on the
problem set in multiple sessions, be sure that you reload your data
abstraction definitions each time, before doing <TT>setup</TT>.  You need
not turn in anything for this exercise.

Make a collection of primitive painters to use in the rest of this

new painter of each of the four primitive types: a uniform grey level
made with <TT>number-&gt;painter</TT>, something defined with <TT>
