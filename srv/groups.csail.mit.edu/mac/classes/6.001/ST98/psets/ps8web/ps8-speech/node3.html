<P>
Begin by loading the code for problem set 8.  The first thing to try
is to see how Scheme deals with streams of inputs you type from the
keyboard.  The code for the problem set includes a procedure <TT>
input-stream</TT> that generates a stream of the expressions you type, and
also a procedure <TT>stream-pp</TT> that pretty-prints a stream one
element at a time.
<P>
Try evaluating <TT>(stream-pp (input-stream))</TT>.  If
you are in the <TT>*scheme*</TT> buffer, you should see a prompt at the
bottom of the screen requesting input.  Type an expression followed by
<font size=-1><small>ENTER</small></font>.  Scheme will pretty-print the expression and request more
input.  This input stream is a potentially infinite stream: you can
keep entering expressions for as long as you like.  To terminate the
stream type a period.  Alternatively, you can break out the input by
typing <TT>C-g</TT> (i.e., <font size=-1><small>CTRL</small></font>-<TT>g</TT>).
<P>
You'll be using <TT>input-stream</TT> to enter streams of phonemes.  As
an alternative to always entering items one at a time at the keyboard,
you can also use the procedure <TT>list-&gt;stream</TT>, which converts a
list of elements into a stream of elements.  Try evaluating
<P>

<PRE>(stream-pp (list-&gt;stream '(th e * c a t * l oo k e d * a t * th e * f i sh)))</PRE>

<P>
and then produce the same printed response using <TT>input-stream</TT>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00031000000000000000">Simulating the front-end processor</A></H2>
<P>
The problem set code includes a procedure <TT>make-random-confusion</TT>
that takes as arguments a (supposedly spoken) phoneme and a noise
level and returns a list of possible phonemes this might be, together
with a weight (probability) to assign to that phoneme choice.  For
example
<P>

<PRE>(make-random-confusion 'a .2)
;Value: ((u .54) (a .32) (o .14))</PRE>

<P>
produces a list that says that the result is ``u'' with likelihood .54,
``a'' with likelihood .32, and ``o'' with likelihood .14.  (Note that
the actual input was ``a''.)
<P>
We'll call such a result a list of <EM>weighted elements</EM>.  A
weighted element consists of some data and an associated weight.  
The problem set code provides a constructor <TT>make-weighted</TT> and
selectors <TT>weighted-data</TT> and <TT>weighted-weight</TT> for handling
weighted elements.
<P>
<TT>Make-random-confusion</TT> is designed so that the weights
of the elements it returns sum to 1 and the elements are listed in
order from largest to smallest weight.  The procedure uses randomness
to simulate the noise, so calling it repeatedly will give different
results.
<P>
The second argument to <TT>make-random-confusion</TT> represents a noise
level, which should be between 0 and 1.  With noise level 0, the
``real'' phoneme will (over many evaluations) tend to have a weight
five times as large as that of the alternatives.  With noise level 1
(very noisy) all the choices will tend to have the same weight--the
phoneme that was actually input will not be preferred to any of the
alternatives.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SECTION00031010000000000000">Computer exercise 1:</A></H4>
<P>
Write a procedure <TT>simulate-front-end</TT> that takes a stream of
phonemes and a noise level as arguments and maps <TT>
make-random-confusion</TT> along the stream to produce the stream of
weighted alternatives.  Using this, implement procedures <TT>
phoneme-input-stream</TT> and <TT>noisy-phoneme-input-stream</TT> that
simulate the operation of the front-end processor on a stream of
phonemes you type at the keyboard.  (Use noise levels of 0 and 1 for
the two streams.)
Try these out and observe the
results.  Also implement <TT>phoneme-stream-from-list</TT> and <TT>
noisy-phoneme-stream-from-list</TT> that simulate the front-end processor
operating on a given list of phonemes.  Turn in listings of your
definitions, and also the result of evaluating

<PRE>(stream-pp (noisy-phoneme-stream-from-list '(p i g)))</PRE>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00032000000000000000">Splitting the stream into ``words''</A></H2>
<P>
Now that we can simulate streams of phoneme alternatives coming from
the front-end processor, let's split these into words so we can try to
identify them.  The procedure <TT>split-stream</TT>, included in the
problem set code, takes as arguments a stream and a predicate.  It
divides the stream into chunks, producing a stream of lists, where
each list is a chunk of consecutive elements of the stream.  Stream
elements that satisfy the predicate are assumed to be markers that
signal the beginning of a new chunk.  These markers are not included
in any of the chunks.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SECTION00032010000000000000">Computer exercise 2:</A></H4>
<P>
Using <TT>split-stream</TT>, implement a procedure <TT>
split-stream-at-silences</TT> that chunks the stream into ``words'' by
splitting the stream at the stars.  Demonstrate your
procedure by using <TT>stream-pp</TT> to look at the result of splitting
a <TT>phoneme-input-stream</TT> where you input a short phrase such as
<P>

<PRE>a * p i g * l oo k e d * a t * th e * b i g * d o g</PRE>

You should see your output printed a word at a time, so you won't
see anything printed until you type a star.  (Note: When <TT>
make-random-confusion</TT> is given a ``phoneme'' symbol that is not in
its table (e.g., a star) it returns a weighted object with that symbol
as data and a weight of 1.  So to test for a star, you should test
whether the data part of the object is the symbol <TT>*</TT>.)

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00033000000000000000">Finding real words</A></H2>
<P>
Now that we have the stream divided into chunks, we need to decipher
each chunk into possible words.  We'll start by generating all
possible choices of phoneme sequences for each chunk,
using the procedure <TT>all-choices</TT> which you reviewed for tutorial.
We'll then filter these choices to find the ones
that correspond to words in the dictionary.
<P>
To permit you to do the filtering, the problem set code includes a
procedure called <TT>word-in-dictionary?</TT> that takes a list of
phonemes and checks whether this is a word in the dictionary.  (In our
idealized implementation, this amounts to simply concatenating the
phonemes and checking whether this produces a word in the dictionary.)
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SECTION00033010000000000000">Computer exercise 3:</A></H4>
<P>
Implement this plan. First, to provide some test data, create a
``chunk'' of phonemes corresponding to a single word:
<P>

<PRE>(define one-chunk
     (stream-car
      (split-stream-at-silences
       (phoneme-stream-from-list '(c a t)))))</PRE>

<P>
Note that the chunk here is a list--<TT>split-stream-at-silences</TT>
produces a stream of lists, and you are taking the first element in
that stream.  Since <TT>one-chunk</TT> is a list you can look at it by
pretty printing it with <TT>pp</TT> (not <TT>stream-pp</TT>).  You should
find that there are 4 choices for the first phoneme (``c'' and three
others), 3 choices for the second, and 4 choices for the third. Now
generate the list of all choices.  How many choices are there?
<P>
Next, implement a procedure called <TT>sensible?</TT> that takes
a list of weighted phonemes and uses <TT>word-in-dictionary?</TT>  to see
if this is in the dictionary.  (<TT>Word-in-dictionary?</TT> expects just
the phoneme data, not the weights, so you'll have to extract these
from the weighted phonemes.)
<P>
Having done this, you should be able to filter the list of choices to find the
sensible ones, e.g.,
<P>

<PRE>(pp (filter sensible? (all-choices one-chunk)))</PRE>

<P>
You should find four possibilities that match words in our
dictionary.  What are these?

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00033020000000000000">Computer exercise 4:</A></H4>
<P>
Your result in exercise 3 should produce ``words'' that are lists of
weighted phonemes.  For further processing, it will be convenient to
combine these weights to get an overall weight for the word
rather than preserving the weights of the individual phonemes.  Write a
procedure <TT>combine-weighted</TT> that accomplishes this by taking a
list of weighted elements and producing a single weighted element.
The data part of the result should be a list of the data items of the
individual weighted elements in the argument list, and the weight part
of the result should be the product of the individual weights.  Here's
an example:
<P>

<PRE>(combine-weighted '((c .6) (a .74) (t .5)))
;Value: ((c a t) .222)</PRE>

<P>
By mapping <TT>combine-weighted</TT> down the list of results in exercise
3, you should get a list of possible words, each with a weight.
You can now pass this result to a procedure called <TT>normalize-weights</TT>,
which is supplied with the problem set code.  <TT>
Normalize-weights</TT> takes a list of weighted elements and normalizes
the weights so that the sum of the weights is 1, and hence weights
can be interpreted as probabilities.  It also orders the list from
largest to smallest weight.
<P>
Finally, define a procedure called <TT>possible-words</TT>, which
performs all the operations that you did here and in exercise 3.
Namely, <TT>possible-words</TT> should take as argument a chunk of output
from the front-end processor, i.e., a list each of whose elements is a
list of weighted phonemes.  The procedure should generate all choices
of phoneme sequences, filter these to find sequences in the
dictionary, map <TT>combine-weighted</TT> down the resulting list, and
finally normalize the weights.
<P>
Test your implementation of <TT>possible-words</TT> by applying it to
<TT>one-chunk</TT> from exercise 3.  Also try evaluating
<P>

<PRE>(stream-pp
 (stream-map possible-words
             (split-stream-at-silences
              (phoneme-input-stream))))</PRE>

<P>
and typing a stream of phonemes (with words separated by stars) to see
the stream of possible words for each phoneme sequence you enter.

  Suppose you enter a phoneme sequence
for which there are no possible words in the dictionary.  This should
appear in your output from exercise 4 as an empty list.  To make this
more uniform with the other lists of possible words, it would be good
to replace this with a list containing an actual weighted element.
Write such a procedure, <TT>flag-unrecognized</TT>, which simply returns
its argument, unless its argument is the empty list, in which case it
returns a list of one weighted word whose data is the symbol <TT>
*unrecognized*</TT> and whose weight is 1.  Try your test from the end of
exercise 4 again, only this time also stream-mapping the result
through <TT>flag-unrecognized</TT>, and see what happens if you type a
mixture of words and gibberish.

Now put all this processing together by defining a procedure called
<TT>recognize</TT>, which takes a phoneme stream (with words delineated
by stars) and returns the stream of weighted choices for words.
Namely, <TT>recognize</TT> should split the stream at silences, stream
map <TT>possible-words</TT> along the result, and stream map this through
<TT>flag-unrecognized</TT>.  Test your procedure by trying it on <TT>

<P>
With <TT>recognize</TT> from exercise 6 in hand, we're now in an
analogous position to where we started with the results of the
front-end processor.  Rather than a stream of lists of weighted
phoneme choices to assemble into words, we now have a stream of lists
of weighted word choices.  Can we perform the analogous
operation--comb through the possible choices of words to produce
phrases and sentences?
<P>
Let's start by simply generating all possible choices:  Take a stream
of word possibilities generated by <TT>recognize</TT>, transform this to
a list (assume this is a finite stream), pass the result to <TT>
all-choices</TT> and combine the weights and normalize them.  As an
example, try the following
<P>

<PRE>(define (possible-phrases phoneme-stream)
  (normalize-weights
   (map
    combine-weighted
    (all-choices (stream-&gt;list (recognize phoneme-stream))))))</PRE>

<P>
<H4><A NAME="SECTION00034010000000000000">Computer exercise 7:</A></H4>
<P>
Try the above approach.  As test cases, use
<PRE>(phoneme-stream-from-list '(a * b i g * p i g * r a n * b y * th e * d o g))</PRE>
and also <TT>phoneme-input-stream</TT>. (Notice that you won't get any
result printed here until you type a period to terminate the input
stream.)  Also try using <TT>noisy-phoneme-stream-from-list</TT> and <TT>
noisy-phoneme-input-stream</TT>.  Just as with the original problem of
assembling phonemes into words, you should find that there are many
potential sequences of words, only a few of which are sensible
phrases.
