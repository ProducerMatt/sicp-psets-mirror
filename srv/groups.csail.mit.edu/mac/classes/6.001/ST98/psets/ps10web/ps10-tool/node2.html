<P>
A complete listing of the TOOL interpreter is appended to this problem
set.  This section leads you through the most important parts,
describing how they differ from the Scheme evaluator in section 4.1.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SECTION00020100000000000000">EVAL and APPLY</A></H3>
<P>
We've named the eval procedure <TT>tool-eval</TT> so as not to confuse it
with Scheme's ordinary <TT>eval</TT>.  The only difference between <TT>
tool-eval</TT> and the <TT>eval</TT> in chapter 4 are the new cases added to
handle the new special forms: <TT>define-generic-function</TT>, <TT>
define-method</TT>, <TT>define-class</TT>, and <TT>make</TT>.  Each clause dispatches
to the appropriate handler for that form.  Note that we have deleted
<TT>lambda</TT>; all TOOL functions are defined with <TT>
define-generic-function</TT>.<A NAME="tex2html4" HREF="footnode.html#381"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://swissnet.ai.mit.edu/latex2html-lib/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A>
<P>
<PRE>(define (tool-eval exp env)
  (cond ((self-evaluating? exp) exp)
        ((variable? exp) (lookup-variable-value exp env))
        ((quoted? exp) (text-of-quotation exp))

        ((definition? exp) (eval-definition exp env))
        ((if? exp) (eval-if exp env))
        ;;we've omitted lambda

        (else (error &quot;Unknown expression type -- EVAL &gt;&gt; &quot; exp))))</PRE>

<P>
<TT>Apply</TT> also gets an extra clause that dispatches to a
procedure that handles applications of generic functions.
<P>
<PRE>(define (tool-apply procedure arguments)
  (cond ((primitive-procedure? procedure)
         (apply-primitive-procedure procedure arguments))
        ((compound-procedure? procedure)
         (eval-sequence
          (procedure-body procedure)
          (extend-environment (procedure-parameters procedure)
                              arguments
                              (procedure-environment procedure))))
        ((generic-function? procedure)
         (apply-generic-function procedure arguments))
        (else (error &quot;Unknown procedure type -- APPLY&quot;))))</PRE>

<P>
<H3><A NAME="SECTION00020200000000000000">New data structures</A></H3>
<P>
A <I>class</I> is represented by a data structure that contains the
class name, a list of slots for that class, and a list of all the
ancestors of the class.  For instance, in our cat example above, we
would have a class with the name <TT>&lt;house-cat&gt;</TT>, slots <TT>
(address size breed)</TT>, and superclasses <TT>(&lt;cat&gt; &lt;object&gt;)</TT>.  Note
that the slot names include <I>all</I> the slots for that class (i.e.,
including the slots for the superclass).  Similarly, the list of
ancestors of a class includes the superclass and all of its ancestors.
<P>
A <I>generic function</I> is a data structure that contains the name of
the function and a list of the methods defined for that function.
Each method is a pair--the specializers and the resulting procedure
to use.  The specializers are a list of classes to which the arguments
must belong in order for the method to be applicable.  The procedure
is represented as an ordinary Scheme procedure.
<P>
An <I>instance</I> is a structure that contains the class of the instance and
the list of values for the slots.
<P>
See the attached code for details of the selectors and constructors
for these data structures.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00021000000000000000">Defining generic functions and methods</A></H2>
<P>
The special form
<TT>(define-generic-function <I>name</I>)</TT>
is handled by the following procedure:
<P>
<PRE>(define (eval-generic-function-definition exp env)
  (let ((name (generic-function-definition-name exp)))
    (let ((val (make-generic-function name)))
      (define-variable! name val env)
      (list 'defined 'generic 'function: name))))</PRE>

<P>
This procedure extracts the <I>name</I> portion of the expression and
calls <TT>make-generic-function</TT> to create a new generic function.
Then it binds <I>name</I> to the new generic function in the given
environment.  The value returned is a message to the user, which will
be printed by the read-eval-print loop.
<P>
<TT>Eval-define-method</TT> handles the special form
<TT>(define-method <I>generic-function</I> (<I>params-and-classes</I>) . <I>body</I>)</TT>
<P>
For example
<P>
<PRE>(define-method say ((cat &lt;cat&gt;) (stuff &lt;number&gt;))
          (newline)
          (print '(cats never discuss numbers))
          'done)</PRE>

<P>
In general here, <I>generic-function</I> is the generic function to
which the method will be added, <I>params-and-classes</I> is a list of
parameters for this method and the classes to which they must belong,
and <I>body</I> is a procedure body, just as for an ordinary Scheme
procedure.<A NAME="tex2html5" HREF="footnode.html#246"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://swissnet.ai.mit.edu/latex2html-lib/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A> The syntax procedures for this form include
appropriate procedures to select out these pieces (see the code).
<P>
<TT>Eval-define-method</TT> first finds the generic function.  Notice
that the <I>generic-function</I> piece of the expression must be
evaluated to obtain the actual generic function.  <TT>
Eval-define-method</TT> disassembles the list of <I>params-and-classes</I>
into separate lists of parameters and classes.  The parameters, the
<I>body</I>, and the environment are combined to form a procedure, just
as in Scheme.  The classes become the specializers for this method.
Finally, the method is installed into the generic function.
<P>
<PRE>(define (eval-define-method exp env)
  (let ((gf (tool-eval (method-definition-generic-function exp) env)))
    (if (not (generic-function? gf))
        (error &quot;Unrecognized generic function -- DEFINE-METHOD &gt;&gt; &quot;
               (method-definition-generic-function exp))
        (let ((params (method-definition-parameters exp)))
          (install-method-in-generic-function
           gf
           (map (lambda (p) (paramlist-element-class p env))
                params)
           (make-procedure (map paramlist-element-name params)
                           (method-definition-body exp)
                           env))
          (list 'added 'method 'to 'generic 'function:
                (generic-function-name gf))))))</PRE>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00022000000000000000">Defining classes and instances</A></H2>
<P>
The special form
<TT>
(define-class <I>name</I> <I>superclass</I> . <I>slots</I>)
</TT>
is handled by
<P>
<PRE>(define (eval-define-class exp env)
  (let ((superclass (tool-eval (class-definition-superclass exp)
                               env)))
    (if (not (class? superclass))
        (error &quot;Unrecognized superclass -- MAKE-CLASS &gt;&gt; &quot;
               (class-definition-superclass exp))
        (let ((name (class-definition-name exp))
              (all-slots (collect-slots
                          (class-definition-slot-names exp)
                          superclass)))
          (let ((new-class
                 (make-class name superclass all-slots)))
            (define-variable! name new-class env)
            (list 'defined 'class: name))))))</PRE>

<P>
The only tricky part here is that we have to collect all the slots from
all the ancestor classes to combine with the slots declared for this
particular class.  This is accomplished by the procedure <TT>
collect-slots</TT> (see the code).
<P>
The final special form
<TT>(make <I>class</I> <I>slot-names-and-values</I>)</TT>
is handled by the procedure <TT>eval-make</TT>.  This
constructs an instance for the specified class, with the designated slot
values.  See the attached code for details.
<P>

<B>This is a lot to absorb, isn't it?</B>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00023000000000000000">Applying generic functions</A></H2>
<P>
Here is where the fun starts, and what all the preceding machinery was
for.  When we apply a generic function to some arguments, we first
find all the methods that are applicable, given the classes of the
arguments.  This gives us a list of methods, of which we will use the
first one.  (We'll see why the first one in a minute.)  We extract the
procedure for that method and apply that procedure to the arguments.
Note the subtle recursion here: <TT>apply-generic-function</TT> (below)
calls <TT>tool-apply</TT> with the procedure part of the method.
<P>
<PRE>(define (apply-generic-function generic-function arguments)
  (let ((methods (compute-applicable-methods-using-classes
                  generic-function
                  (map class-of arguments)))) 
    (if (null? methods)
        (error &quot;No method found -- APPLY-GENERIC-FUNCTION&quot;)
        (tool-apply (method-procedure (car methods)) arguments))))</PRE>

<P>
To compute the list of ``applicable methods'' we first find all
methods for that generic function that can be applied, given the list
of classes for the arguments.  We then sort these according to an
ordering called <TT>method-more-specific</TT>.  The idea is that the
first method in the sorted list will be the most specific one, which
is the the best method to apply for those arguments.
<P>
<PRE>(define (compute-applicable-methods-using-classes generic-function classes)
  (sort
   (filter
    (lambda (method)
      (method-applies-to-classes? method classes))
    (generic-function-methods generic-function))
   method-more-specific?))</PRE>

<P>
To test if a method is applicable, given a list of classes of the
supplied arguments, we examine the method specializers and see
whether, for each supplied argument, the class of the argument is a
subclass of the class required by the specializer:
<P>
<PRE>(define (method-applies-to-classes? method classes)
  (define (check-classes supplied required)
    (cond ((and (null? supplied) (null? required)) true)
          ;;something left over, so number of arguments does not match
          ((or (null? supplied) (null? required)) false)
          ((subclass? (car supplied) (car required))
           (check-classes (cdr supplied) (cdr required)))
          (else false)
          ))
    (check-classes classes (method-specializers method)))</PRE>

<P>
To determine subclasses, we use the class ancestor list: <TT>class1</TT>
is a subclass of <TT>class2</TT> if <TT>class2</TT> is a member of the class
ancestor list of <TT>class1</TT>:
<P>
<PRE>(define (subclass? class1 class2)
  (or (eq? class1 class2)
      (memq class2 (class-ancestors class1))))</PRE>

<P>
Finally, we need a way to compare two methods to see which one is
``more specific.''  We do this by looking at the method specializers.
<TT>Method1</TT> is considered to be more specific than <TT>method2</TT> if,
for each class in the list of specializers, the class for <TT>
method1</TT> is a subclass of the class for <TT>method2</TT>.  (See the
procedure <TT>method-more-specific?</TT> in the attached code.)
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00024000000000000000">Classes for Scheme data</A></H2>
<P>
TOOL is arranged so that ordinary Scheme data objects--numbers,
symbols, and so on--appear as TOOL objects.  For example, any number
is an instance of a predefined class called <TT>&lt;number&gt;</TT>, which is
a class with no slots, whose superclass is <TT>&lt;object&gt;</TT>.  The TOOL
interpreter accomplishes this by having a special set of classes,
called <TT>scheme-object-classes</TT>.  If a TOOL object is not an
ordinary instance (i.e., an instance data structure as described
above), the interpreter checks whether it belongs to one of the
Scheme object classes by applying an appropriate test.  For example,
anything that satisfies the Scheme predicate <TT>number?</TT> is considered to
be an instance of <TT>&lt;number&gt;</TT>.  See the code for details.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00025000000000000000">Initial environment and driver loop</A></H2>
<P>
When the interpreter is initialized, it builds a global environment
that has bindings for <TT>true</TT>, <TT>false</TT>, <TT>nil</TT>, the
pre-defined classes, and the initial set of generic functions listed
at the end of section 1.  The driver loop is essentially the same as
the <TT>driver-loop</TT> procedure in chapter 4 of the book.  One cute
difference is that this driver loop prints values using the TOOL
generic function <TT>print</TT>.  By defining new methods for <TT>
print</TT>, you can change the way the interpreter prints data objects.
