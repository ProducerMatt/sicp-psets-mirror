<P>
This final question asks you to consider a tricky issue in language
design.  We are not requiring you to actually implement your design.
Nevertheless, we do expect you to think carefully about the issues
involved and to give a careful description of the solution you come up
with.  Don't think that this is a straightforward exercise--designers
of object-oriented languages are still arguing about it.
<P>
The major way in which TOOL is simpler than other object-oriented
languages is that each class has only <I>one</I> immediate superclass.
As illustrated with message-passing systems (lecture on March 19),
there are cases where it is convenient to have a class inherit
behavior from more than one kind of class.<A NAME="tex2html6" HREF="footnode.html#386"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://swissnet.ai.mit.edu/latex2html-lib/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A>
<P>
This will involve some changes to TOOL.  As a start, the syntax for
<TT>define-class</TT> must be modified to accept a list of superclasses
rather than a single superclass.  Let's assume that <TT>define-class</TT>
now takes a list of superclasses.  For instance, going back to our
original example about cats, we might have:
<P>
<PRE>(define-class &lt;fancy-house-cat&gt; (&lt;house-cat&gt; &lt;show-cat&gt;))</PRE>

<P>
This new class should inherit from both <TT>&lt;house-cat&gt;</TT> and <TT>
&lt;show-cat&gt;</TT>.  In general, when the new class is constructed, it should
inherit methods and slots from <I>all</I> its superclasses (and their
ancestors).
<P>
However, it's not obvious what inheritance should mean.  For example,
suppose we have a generic function <TT>eat</TT> and we define methods as
follows:
<P>
<PRE>(define-method eat ((c &lt;house-cat&gt;))
   (print '(yum: I'm hungry)))

(define-method eat ((c &lt;show-cat&gt;))
   (print '(I eat only caviar)))</PRE>

<P>
What should happen when we ask a fancy-house-cat (which is
both a show-cat and a house-cat) to eat?  More generally, what is the
``most specific method'' that should be used when a generic function
is applied to its arguments, given that some of the arguments may have
multiple superclasses?  What are the new kinds of choices that arise?
How should the language give the user the ability to control these
choices?  (Or maybe it <I>shouldn't</I> give the user this level of
control.)
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SECTION00040010000000000000">Post-computer exercise 6:</A></H4>
 You are now a language designer.
Your task is to design an extension to TOOL so that it handles
classes with multiple superclasses.  Three of the issues you have to
deal with are: (a) What should be the syntax for defining classes?
(b) What slots does a class get when it is defined?  (c) How is a
method chosen when a generic function is applied to its arguments?
Prepare a design writeup that has three parts:

<P>
<OL>
<LI> Write a clear 2-3 page description of your language extension.
This description should be geared toward the <I>user</I> of the
language.  It should include a simple, but realistic and non-trivial
example of a program that involves multiple superclasses.  The
example should illustrate how your language handles each of the
three issues (a), (b), and (c).  You should also explain how the
language deals with each of these issues in general.
<LI> For each of design choices you illustrated in part 1, give an
<I>alternative</I> choice you could have made, and explain briefly why
you think your choice is better.  If you can't think of any other
choice you might have made, then say so.
<LI> As carefully as you can (but without actually writing any code)
specify the procedure that the evaluator should follow in choosing
which method to select when applying a generic function to a given
set of arguments.  Your description should be clear enough so that
someone could implement this procedure based upon your specification.
<P>
</OL><H4><A NAME="SECTION00040020000000000000">Optional extra credit</A></H4>
  Implement your design for multiple
superclasses in TOOL and demonstrate that it works.  The TOOL
interpreter was designed to make this not too difficult, but it will
involve a considerable number of small changes to the code and is
likely to be time-consuming.
