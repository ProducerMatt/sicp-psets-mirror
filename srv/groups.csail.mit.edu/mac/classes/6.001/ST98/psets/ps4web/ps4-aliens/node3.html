Our ultimate goal in this problem set is to help the Housing Office
determine what incoming freshthings can be put in the same room, and
to determine what dorms will need to be converted to a different
environment (note that some of them may already have an appropriate
atmosphere for some of these new students!).
<P>
Begin by loading the code for problem set 4.  This defines the
procedures listed above, and the list <TT>*order*</TT> and the initial
database <TT>entering-class</TT>.  The loaded code also defines <TT>
map</TT>, <TT>filter</TT>, and <TT>accumulate</TT> from the book, which you may
find useful in doing the exercises below.  In grading problem sets,
we will be considering the elegance of your code, not only whether or
not it ``works.''  So it will be to your advantage to use aggregate
operations when they are appropriate.  In fact, some of the exercises
below will be very cumbersome to write (and debug!) if you do not use
the aggregate operators.  It would be a good idea to reread pages
112-118 of the book, and to look again at exercise 2.35 before
starting in on these programming exercises.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SECTION00030010000000000000">Computer exercise 1:</A></H4>
 Implement a procedure that, given a
table, returns the list of all the freshthings in the table.  Note
that the result should be a single flat list (not a list with sublists).
Test your procedure by finding all the freshthings in <TT>entering-class</TT>.

<P>
Implement a procedure that takes as argument a table and a list of
conditions and returns the list of all freshthings in the table who
could live under those conditions.  Assume that if a freshthing does
not list a preference in a category, then he/she/it will be
comfortable with any choice.
<P>
For instance, with our sample entering class, if the list of
conditions is <EM>(sulfur, 350K-370K, ultraviolet)</EM>, your procedure
should return all freshthings who could live with a sulfur atmosphere,
a 350K-370K temperature range, and ultraviolet light--namely,
Amoeboid1, Amoeboid2, and Amoeboid3.  Note that this result does not
include Amoeboid4, since Amoeboid4 specified visible light; but the
result does include Amoeboid1, since Amoeboid1 did not specify any
preference for spectrum.  Assume that the list of conditions starts
with an atmosphere preference, lists the preferences in order of
importance, and does not skip over any categories. That is, the list
could be <EM>(methane)</EM> or <EM>(methane, 260K-270K, infrared,
random)</EM>, but not <EM>(260K-270K)</EM> or <EM>(methane, infrared,
random)</EM>.  Turn in a listing of your procedure together with some
tests to demonstrate that it works.
<P>
By the way, the Boston Licensing Board has just informed MIT that it
will not allow students to live in ethanol-atmosphere housing in the
future. How would you use your procedure to find out how many students
could be displaced by this ruling?

<P>
Generalize your answer to exercise 2 so that the list of conditions
can include the symbol <TT>*</TT> to indicate that a category is skipped over.
For example, using <EM>(sulfur, *, visible)</EM> should return all freshthings
except those who specified an atmosphere other than sulfur or a
spectrum other than visible--namely, Amoeboid1 and Amoeboid4.
Similarly, <EM>(*, *, ultraviolet)</EM> should return the list of all
freshthings who can live in an ultraviolet spectrum, i.e., all
freshthings except those who specified a preference for a spectrum
other than ultraviolet.  (There are 10 such freshthings in our sample
entering class.)
<P>
Note that the preferences must still list the categories in order and
include a <TT>*</TT> for each category that is skipped over.  Using your
program, find all the freshthings who could live with an ultraviolet
spectrum and a night cycle.  Find all the freshthings who could live
with a day cycle.
<P>
In this problem, especially, it will really help to think in terms of
aggregate operations.  If you don't do this, it is easy to get lost in
a maze of list operations.  So plan your work carefully.

<P>
Our system currently requires freshthings to indicate their
preferences for categories using our ordering of importance
(atmosphere, temperature, spectrum, cycle).  But this is too rigid.
For instance, my friend Gleep, from the second planet around Proxima
Centauri, is comfortable over a reasonably wide range of temperatures
and atmospheres, but Gleep really needs to be strongly illuminated
with visible light because he is photosynthetic. Wouldn't it be better
to allow freshthings to give only the characteristics that actually
matter to them, independent of order?
<P>
Discuss how you would redesign the system to permit this.  The new
system will need to accept input from freshthings, enter this into the
table, and access the table to find all freshthings who can live
under various conditions (as in exercise 3 above).
<P>
Write a clear but brief (one or two page) explanation describing which
parts of the system need to be changed, and how.  This is a very
open-ended question and there are lots of ways to go about this.  In
grading, we will be more interested in the clarity of your explanation
than in details of coding.  For example, you should describe any new
procedures that must be written and any old procedures that must be
modified and give precise prescriptions of how they should behave.
<P>
If you want to implement some or all of your design, that's fine, but
you need not write any code at all for this problem, provided you give
a clear explanation of how the new system will work and a clear
description of what code needs to be written.  ``Clear'' means that
another person, say another student in the class, could read your
description and write the actual code without difficulty.

Turn in answers to the following questions along with your answers to
the questions in the problem set:
<P>
<OL>
<LI> About how much time did you spend on this homework assignment?
(Reading and preparing the assignment plus computer work.)
<LI> Which scheme system(s) did you use to do this assignment (for
example: 6.001 lab, your own NT machine, your own Win95 machine, your
own Linux machine)?
<LI>
We encourage you to work with others on problem sets as long as you
acknowledge it (see the 6.001 General Information handout).
<UL>
<LI> If you cooperated with other students, LA's, or others, or found portions
of your answers for this problem set in references other than the
text (such as some of the archives), please indicate your
consultants' names and your references.  Also,
explicitly label all text and code you are submitting which is the same as
that being submitted by one of your collaborators.
<LI> Otherwise, write ``I worked alone using only the reference
materials,'' and sign your statement.
