Begin by loading the code for problem set 6.  This will define the
search and data structure procedures listed above.  Just to make sure
everything is working, evaluate
<P>

<PRE>
(search test-data make-df-strategy-1 'a
        (lambda (node) (eq? node 'l)))</PRE>

<P>
This should search the <TT>test-data</TT> graph until the searcher finds
node <TT>l</TT>, and you should see the nodes visited in depth-first order.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SECTION00030010000000000000">Computer exercise 1:</A></H4>
<P>
<TT>Make-df-strategy-1</TT> creates a depth-first search strategy
procedure.  A breadth-first search strategy can be obtained by
modifying <EM>only one line</EM> of the procedure <TT>
make-df-strategy-1</TT>, leaving the total number of characters in the
procedure unchanged!  Do this (name your procedure <TT>
make-bf-strategy-1</TT>), demonstrate that it works on <TT>test-data</TT>,
and write a short (but clear) explanation of why it works.

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00031000000000000000">Marking nodes</A></H2>
<P>
In tutorial exercise 3, you discussed a problem with <TT>
make-df-strategy-1</TT>: it doesn't prevent visiting a node that has
already been examined, and can therefore go into an infinite loop.  As
you saw in lecture on Thursday, March 12, we we can fix the problem by
using a pair of procedures:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> <TT>(note-visited! <EM>node</EM>)</TT>: remembers that we've visited <EM>node</EM>
<LI> <TT>(deja-vu? <EM>node</EM>)</TT>: test whether or not we've visited
<EM>node</EM>
</UL>
<P>
The implementations of the search strategy-maker procedures shown in
lecture all use a global variable to store their state.  If we want to
be able to run several searches concurrently (for example searching
for different goals or using different strategies to see which
finishes first) then it's important that we produce a new pair of
procedures for each strategy procedure.  The following version of a
depth-first strategy-maker does this:
<P>

<PRE>
(define (make-df-strategy goal? neighbors)
  (let ((mark-procedures (make-mark-procedures)))
    (let ((deja-vu? (car mark-procedures))
          (note-visited! (cadr mark-procedures))
          (*to-be-visited* '()))
      (define (try-node candidates)
        (cond ((null? candidates) #F)
              ((deja-vu? (car candidates))
               (try-node (cdr candidates)))
              (else
               (set! *to-be-visited* (cdr candidates))
               (car candidates))))
      (define (where-next? here)
        (note-visited! here)
        (set! *to-be-visited*
              (append (neighbors here) *to-be-visited*))
        (if (goal? here)
            #T
            (try-node *to-be-visited*)))
      where-next?)))</PRE>

<P>
Note the procedure used here: <TT>(make-mark-procedures)</TT> returns a
list whose first element is a
procedure that works like <TT>deja-vu?</TT> and whose second element is a
procedure that works like <TT>note-visited!</TT>.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SECTION00031010000000000000">Computer exercise 2:</A></H4>
<P>
Implement <TT>make-mark-procedures</TT>.  The procedure should be very
short (less than a dozen lines of code), and you can make use of the
built-in Scheme procedure <TT>memq</TT>.  Do not worry about efficiency.
We're concerned here only with the correctness of the program and with
making sure that you understand how to introduce the local state
necessary to make the procedures work correctly.
<P>
To show that your implementation of <TT>make-mark-procedures</TT> works,
use <TT>search</TT> and <TT>make-df-strategy</TT> to walk sample graph <TT>
web</TT>.  Also modify your breadth-first search strategy maker from
computer exercise 1 to create procedure <TT>make-bf-strategy</TT>, that
makes sure that it visits nodes only once.  Demonstrate that this
procedure works by showing that it can traverse <TT>web</TT>.  Give the
order in which the nodes are visited for depth-first search and for
breadth-first search.

<P>
Now let's turn to the problem of creating a full-text index of
documents on the Web, like the one created by AltaVista.  We'll assume
that we have a graph that represents the World Wide Web, using node
names that correspond to URLs (as in the sample <TT>web</TT> given
earlier).  Remember we're assuming that we have a procedure <TT>
node-&gt;text</TT>, that gets us the alphabetized text at the node.  For
example, <TT>((node-&gt;text web) 'http://mit.edu/6.001)</TT> yields the
list (at least it did for the real 6.001 web page on February 9,
1998):

<P>
Let's create a data abstraction for the index.  It consists of three
procedures:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> <TT>(initialize-index!)</TT>: Clears any previous information from
the index.
<LI> <TT>(add-to-index! url list-of-words)</TT>: Add all of the words to the
index, together with some information to indicate that they occur in
this URL.
<LI> <TT>(find-in-index word)</TT>: Returns a list of all the URLs that have
been entered into the index as associated with that word.
</UL>
<P>
Here's an example of how it should work:
<P>

<PRE>
(define (index-document! web)
  (let ((get-text (node-&gt;text web)))
    (lambda (url)
     ;; Fetch the text of the URL and insert it into index
     (add-to-index! url (get-text url)))))

(initialize-index!)
((index-document! web)
 'http://mit.edu/6.001)  ; Index one document
(find-in-index 'help)    ; What documents have &quot;help&quot; in them?
   ==&gt; (http://mit.edu/6.001)
(find-in-index '*magic*) ; Which documents have &quot;*magic*&quot; in them?
   ==&gt; #F</PRE>

<P>
<H4><A NAME="SECTION00032010000000000000">Computer exercise 3:</A></H4>
<P>
Write the three procedures defined above.  Notice that you will need a
variable shared by all three procedures.  Make sure that this variable
is visible to only these three procedures and not to any other Scheme
procedure.  (Hint: Your program won't be just three top-level
definitions.)
<P>
<B>Note:</B> A professionally written version of these procedures would
pay careful attention to the efficiency of the algorithm used, and
would probably involve alphabetical order and complicated data
structures.  You should <EM>not</EM> worry about this unless you find
yourself with spare time on your hands -- and if you do have that
time, you might want to look at the Scheme reference manual definition
of <TT>sort</TT>, <TT>string&lt;?</TT>, and <TT>symbol-&gt;string</TT>.  Your tutor
will thank you for making your solution easy to understand, even at
the expense of performance (and, in later life, many of your
colleagues will feel the same way!).

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00032020000000000000">Computer exercise 4:</A></H4>
<P>
Now let's simulate what AltaVista's spider does: Crawl the entire web
(use a goal procedure that always returns false) and produce a
full-text index of everything you find.  Write a procedure, <TT>
make-web-index</TT>, similar to the procedure <TT>search</TT>, that
initializes the index, finds all the URLs that can be reached from a
given initial URL, indexes them, and returns a procedure that can be
used to find all the URLs of documents containing a given word.  Your
procedure should use <TT>make-bf-strategy</TT> from computer exercise 2
to actually crawl the web.
<P>
You can test your program by trying the following example.
Which document(s) do you find?
<P>

<PRE>
(define find-documents
  (make-web-index web 'http://mit.edu/6.001))

<P>
Let's put everything together by comparing the performance of crawling
the web versus using a full-text index of the web.  This won't be a
full or fair comparison, but it should give you some ideas about
tradeoffs in designing real systems that analyze the contents of the
actual Web.  To investigate crawling, write two procedures:
<P>
<OL>
<LI> <TT>(search-any web start-node word)</TT> searches the web
(using <TT>make-bf-strategy</TT>) and returns the <EM>first</EM> document
that it finds that contains the given word.  It should stop searching
as soon as it finds such a document.
<LI> <TT>(search-all web start-node word)</TT> searches the <EM>entire</EM> web
(using <TT>make-bf-strategy</TT>) and returns <EM>all</EM> documents
that contain the given word.
</OL>
<P>
We'll compare this with the technique of indexing the web using <TT>
make-web-index</TT> and <TT>find-documents</TT>.
<P>
We've provided a program, (<TT>generate-random-web <EM>size</EM>)</TT>, that
you can use to create webs of different sizes (total number of nodes)
with some randomly generated text.  Use this to build several webs.
You don't have to make them too big; the procedure will in fact not
build anything larger than size 200.  For each web, measure the amount
of time it takes, starting from the node named <TT>*start*</TT>:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> to use <TT>search-any</TT> to find a document containing the word ``help'';
<LI> to use <TT>search-any</TT> to find a document containing a word
that is not in the web: ``Chuckvest'';
<LI> to use <TT>search-all</TT> to find all documents containing the word &quot;help&quot;;
<LI> to run <TT>make-web-index</TT> to create an index for the web;
<LI> to use <TT>find-documents</TT> to find all documents containing the word
``help'', not including the time needed to create the index.
<LI> to use <TT>find-documents</TT> to find all documents containing the word
``Chuckvest'' (there won't be any), 
not including the time needed to create the index.
</UL>
<P>
To enable you to do timing, we've included the same <TT>timed</TT>
procedure that you used in problem set 2.
<P>
Write a few short paragraphs explaining the measurements you made and
what conclusions you might want to draw about searching and crawling
the real Web.  If you were building a service to help people find
information on the Web, what kinds of factors would you consider in
deciding which method to use?
