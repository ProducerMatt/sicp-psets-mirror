<h2 align=center>Code to load for this problem set</h2>

<b>For GNU/Linux users</b><br>
<a href="ps1.tar.gz">Gzipped tar file format</a>.  Put this tar file in the
psets directory, go to that directory, and type<br><p>
<code>
tar xzvf ps1.tar.gz
</code>
</p>
If this works, you can remove the tar file.
<p>

<b>For Windows95 and Windows NT users</b><br>
<a href="ps1.zip">Zip
file format</a>.  Unzip this file in the into the directory you set up
as your problem sets directory when you installed 6.001 Scheme (this
will be a directory with the name <code>psets</code> under the
directory you actually specified).  The result should place
in the <tt>psets</tt> directory a file called
 <tt>probsets.scm</tt>, together with a directory called <tt>ps1</tt>
that contains three files: <tt>fovnder.pgm</tt>,
<tt>mix-sp98.pgm</tt>, and <tt>psgo.scm</tt>.

<p>

<h4>Special notes</h4>

<ol>
<li>If you are working in the 6.001 lab, and you are using Netscape at
the same time as you are running Scheme, load the problem set (and
create the graphics windows) <em>before</em> you start Netscape.
Otherwise, the Scheme will fail when it attemps to draw, due to a
fight with Netscape over the contents of the color map.
</ol>
