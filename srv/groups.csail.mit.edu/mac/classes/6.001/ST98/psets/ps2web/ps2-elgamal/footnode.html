<DL> <DT><A NAME="129">...Cryptography</B></A><DD>This problem set is
based on an earlier 6.001 problem set originally written in 1987 by
Ruth Shyu and Eric Grimson and revised in 1992 by David LaMacchia and
Hal Abelson.  There was a major revision by Hal Abelson for 1998
(changing the method of encryption from RSA to ElGamal).

</PRE><DT><A NAME="360">...cryptography</I>.</A><DD>The first publication of this idea appeared in
W. Diffie and M. Hellman, ``New directions in cryptography,'' <I>
IEEE Transactions on Information Theory</I>, IT-22:6, 1976, pp 644-654,
and Diffie and Hellman have been credited with the invention.  In
December 1997, however, the British Communications Electronics
Security Group (part of British intelligence), published a memo
describing how the technique was invented by CESG's Malcolm Williamson
in 1973, but kept secret.  See James Ellis, ``The Story of Non-Secret
Encryption,''

literature on cryptography: Alyssa P. Hacker and Ben Bitdiddle hold
the patent on imaginary characters in 6.001.  The management has
accordingly notified Alice and Bob that they may not participate in
this problem set.

discussed below, are based on work during the early 80s by
cryptographer Taher ElGamal.  ElGamal currently works as a security
expert for Netscape.

</PRE><DT><A NAME="371">...<I>g</I>.</A><DD>There's a bit of number theory we've sloughed over that
guarantees that these algorithms are reasonable.  Given a safe prime,
the odds that a randomly picked <I>g</I> is a generator are about 1 in 2.
Given a prime <I>q</I>, the odds that 2<I>q</I>+1 is also prime are about 1 in
<IMG WIDTH=25 HEIGHT=25 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline669" SRC="img20.gif">.  So trying random guesses is likely to succeed without too
long a wait.

<EM>Blowfish</EM>, was invented by cryptographer Bruce Schneier.  We
won't show you the code for this, which is buried in the guts of the
Scheme system.  For a description of the algorithm see Schneier's book
<EM>Applied Cryptography</EM>, second edition, Wiley, 1996.

</PRE><DT><A NAME="385">...problem</EM>.</A><DD>Actually, if you're
reading very closely, you'll see that we've made an unwarranted
assumption.  What you really need is to solve the so-called <EM>
Diffie-Hellman problem</EM>: given <IMG WIDTH=69 HEIGHT=25 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline719" SRC="img23.gif"> and <IMG WIDTH=69 HEIGHT=32 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline721" SRC="img24.gif">, compute <IMG WIDTH=77 HEIGHT=32 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline723" SRC="img25.gif">.  As far as anyone knows, the
only way to do this is to compute discrete logs, and for many classes
of primes the discrete log problem and the Diffie-Hellman problem have
been proved equivalent.

</PRE><DT><A NAME="240">...fast.</A><DD>As a consequence of this, the
encryption you are implementing in this problem set really is a
high-grade security method.  For instance, the encryption system PGP
5.0 uses ElGamal encryption with a suggested prime size of around 300
digits.  If anyone has the ability to crack something like that, they
aren't talking.

and comparing, because <IMG WIDTH=291 HEIGHT=26 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline811" SRC="img36.gif">.

</PRE><DT><A NAME="247">...result.</A><DD>There are tremendous subtleties in designing a good
message-digest function.  One property it should have is that it
should be computationally infeasible to find two strings that hash to
the same value.  The particular function used here, called MD5, was
invented by Ron Rivest of MIT.
