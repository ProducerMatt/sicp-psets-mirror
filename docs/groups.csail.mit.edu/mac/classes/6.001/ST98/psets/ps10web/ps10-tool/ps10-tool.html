<LI> Issued:  Tuesday, April 10, 1998
<LI> Tutorial preparation - NOT! Due to the holiday on April 20 and
21, there are no tutorials next week.
<LI> Written solutions due: Friday, April 24 in recitation
<LI> Reading: Study section 4.1 before starting on this assignment.
Read chapter sections 4.2 and 4.3 before coming to lecture on April
23.
<LI> Code:  The following code (attached) should be studied as part
      of this problem set:

This problem set is probably the most difficult one of the semester,
but paradoxically, the one that asks you to write the least amount of
code, and for which you should have to spend the least time
programming, <EM>provided that you prepare before you start</EM>.  In
particular, you will need to gain a good mastery of the metacircular
evaluator in section 4.1 of the notes--this material is critical, not
only to this problem set, but to all of the material for the remainder
of the semester.
<P>
This problem set has been designed so that the interpreter you will be
dealing with is an extension of the metacircular evaluator.  The
implementation below is described with reference to the programs in
the book.  So in order to understand what is going on, it will be
necessary to work through section 4.1 before starting on this
assignment.
<P>
Instead of asking you to do a lot of implementation in this problem
set, we are asking you to assume the role of language designer, and to
think about and discuss some issues in the design of languages for
object-oriented programming.  Note especially that there is a
significant part of this problem set to be completed <EM>after</EM> you
have finished with the programming assignment.
<P>
<P>
<P>
Although Object-Oriented programming has become very popular, the
design of languages to support Object-Oriented programming is still an
area of active research.  In this problem set, you will be dealing
with issues that are not well-understood, and around which there are
major disagreements among language designers.  The questions in this
problem set will not ask you to supply ``right answers.''  Instead,
they will ask you to make reasonable design choices, and to be able to
defend these choices.  We hope you will appreciate that, once you have
come to grips with the notion of an interpreter, you are in a position
to address major issues in language design, even issues that are at
the forefront of current research.<A NAME="tex2html1" HREF="footnode.html#380"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://swissnet.ai.mit.edu/latex2html-lib/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A>
<P>
We've already seen two different approaches to implementing generic
operations.  One is <I>data-directed programming</I>, which relies on a
table to dispatch based on the types of arguments.  The second method,
<I>message-passing</I>, represents objects as procedures with local
state.  As we saw in problem set 7, these objects can be arranged in
complex <I>inheritance</I> relationships, such as ``a robot is a kind
of person.''
<P>
One drawback with both of these approaches is that they make a
distinction between generic operations and ordinary procedures, or
between message-passing objects and ordinary data.  This makes it
awkward, for example, to extend an ordinary procedure so that it also
works as a generic operation on new types of data.  For instance, we
might like to extend the addition operator <TT>+</TT> so that it can add
two vectors, rather than having to define a separate <TT>vector-add</TT>
procedure.
<P>
Object-oriented languages have attempted to integrate objects into the
core of the language, rather than building an object system as an
extension of a non-object language.  In these object-oriented
languages, every data type (object) belongs to a class, and there
aren't really stand-alone procedures--but rather methods that are
shared by various classes.  This integrated approach was pioneered in
the language <EM>Smalltalk</EM>, which was developed at Xerox PARC
starting in 1971.  This is also the approach used in <EM>Java</EM>.
<P>
The language we will implement in this problem set is called <EM>MIT
TOOL</EM> (Tiny Object Oriented Language).  It is most closely related to
<EM>Dylan</EM>, a language developed at the at the (former) Apple
Research Center in Cambridge.  Dylan received a lot of attention when
it was introduced in 1991, but its fortunes have waned (along with
Apple's).  MIT Tool is a very simplified version of Dylan, and it is
designed to make the implementation an easy extension of the
metacircular evaluator of chapter 4.
