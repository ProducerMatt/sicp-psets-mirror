<P>
When you load the code for this problem set, the entire TOOL
interpreter code (attached) will be loaded into Scheme.  However, in
order to do the programming assignment, you will need to modify only a
tiny bit of the interpreter.  This code has been separated out in the
file <TT>ps10-mod.scm</TT>, so you can edit it conveniently.  (You may
also need to define some auxiliary procedures.)
<P>
To start the TOOL interpreter, type <TT>(initialize-tool)</TT>.  This
initializes the global environment and starts the read-eval-print
loop.  To evaluate a TOOL expression, type the expression after the
prompt, followed by <font size=-1><small>CTRL</small></font>-<TT>x</TT> <font size=-1><small>CTRL</small></font>-<TT>e</TT>.
<P>
In order to keep the TOOL interpreter simple, we have not provided any
mechanism for handling errors.  Any error (such as an unbound
variable) will bounce you back into Scheme's error handler.  To get
back to TOOL, quit out of the error and restart the driver loop by
typing <TT>(driver-loop)</TT>.  If you make an error that requires
reinitializing the environment, you can rerun <TT>initialize-tool</TT>,
but this will make you lose any new classes, generic functions, or
methods you have defined.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SECTION00030010000000000000">Computer exercise 1:</A></H4>
 Show how to implement
two-dimensional vector arithmetic in TOOL by extending the generic
functions <TT>+</TT> and <TT>*</TT>, which are already predefined to work
on numbers.  Define a class <TT>&lt;vector&gt;</TT> with slots <TT>xcor</TT> and
<TT>ycor</TT>.  Arithmetic should be defined so that adding two vectors
produces the vector sum, and multiplying two vectors produces the dot
product
<BR><IMG WIDTH=367 HEIGHT=17 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="displaymath311" SRC="img1.gif"><BR>
Multiplying a number times a vector, or a vector times a number,
should scale the vector by the number.  Adding a vector plus a number
is not defined.  Also define a generic function length, such that the
length of a vector is its length and the length of a number is its
absolute value.  Also, add a <TT>print</TT> method for vectors so that
TOOL will print vectors showing their xcor and ycor.  
Turn in your
definitions and a brief interaction showing that they work.
Here are some
useful definitions (not included in the problem set code) that
illustrate one way to get started:
<P>
<PRE>(define-method - ((x &lt;number&gt;))
  (- 0 x))

(define-generic-function square)
(define-method square ((x &lt;object&gt;))
  (* x x))</PRE>

 (This is really an exercise in
reading code, not programming.)  Towards the end of section 1 of this
problem set, there was an example showing the result of evaluating the
expression <TT>(say socks 37)</TT>.
Explain how <TT>apply-generic-function</TT>
finds the
correct <TT>say</TT> method when we ask the cat <TT>socks</TT> to say a
number.  In particular, what are all the applicable methods?  In what
order will they appear after they are sorted according to <TT>
method-more-specific</TT>?

  One annoying thing about TOOL is that if
you define a method before you've defined a generic function for that
method, you will get an error.  For example, in the first example
in section 1, we had to explicitly evaluate
<P>
<PRE>(define-generic-function 4-legged?)</PRE>

before we could evaluate
<PRE>(define-method 4-legged? ((thing &lt;object&gt;))
  'Who-knows?)</PRE>

If we hadn't done this, the second expression would have
given the error that <TT>4-legged?</TT> is undefined.  Modify the TOOL
interpreter so that, if the user attempts to define a method for a
generic function that does not yet exist, TOOL will first
automatically define the generic function.  One thing to consider: In
which environment should the name of the generic function be bound:
the global environment, the environment of the evaluation?  some other
environment?  There is no ``right answer'' to this question--<I>
you</I> are the language designer.  But whatever choice you make, write a
brief paragraph justifying your choice.  In particular, include an
example of a program for which the choice of environment matters,
i.e., where the program would have a different behavior (or perhaps
give an error) if the choice were different.  (Hint: The only
procedure you should need to modify for this exercise is <TT>
eval-define-method</TT>.)  Turn in, along with your design justification,
your modified code together with a brief interaction showing that the
modified interpreter works as intended.)

 Another inconvenience in TOOL is that we
need to use <TT>get-slot</TT> in order to obtain slot values.  It would
be more convenient to have TOOL automatically define selectors for
slots.  For example, it would be nice to be able to get the x and y
coordinates of a vector by typing <TT>(xcor v)</TT> and <TT>(ycor v)</TT>
rather than <TT>(get-slot v 'xcor)</TT> and <TT>(get-slot v 'ycor)</TT>.
Modify the interpreter to do this.  Namely, whenever a class is
defined, TOOL should automatically define a generic function for each
of its slot names, together with a method that returns the
corresponding slot value for arguments of that class.  Turn in a
listing of your code and an example showing that it works.  (Hint:
The only part of interpreter you need to modify for this exercise is
<TT>eval-define-class</TT>.)

 Give some simple example of defining some

subclasses, superclasses, and methods, and which illustrate the
modifications you made in exercises 3 and 4.
