<P>
For this assignment you will need the ID number printed on your MIT ID
card.  Be sure to have it with you when you do the problems.
<P>
To warm up, load the code for problem set 7 and start the simulation
by typing <TT>(setup &lt;<EM>your name</EM>&gt;)</TT>. Play with the world a bit.
One simple thing to do is to stay where you are and run the clock for
a while with <TT>(run-clock &lt;<EM>ticks</EM>&gt;)</TT>.  Since the characters in
our simulated building NE43 have a certain amount of restlessness,
people should come walking by and say hi to you.  Try running the
clock with <TT>*deity-mode*</TT> set to both true and false.  When it is
set to true, you see everything that happens everywhere in the
simulation.  When it is set to false, you see only what happen in the
room you are in.  You'll probably want to set <TT>*deity-mode*</TT> it
false most of the time.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SECTION00050010000000000000">Computer exercise 1:</A></H4>
<P>
Walk the avatar to a room that has a thing called <TT>the-goal</TT> in
it.  Have the avatar <TT>take the-goal</TT>, and <TT>lose</TT> it somewhere
else.  Show a transcript of this session.

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00051000000000000000">Searching the labyrinth</A></H2>
<P>
To solve the previous problem you did not really have to search for
the goal: You had a map (from tutorial exercise 3) and you knew where
the goal was, so you could plan a route and follow it directly.  But
suppose that you are in a world with no map, as in the World Wide Web.
As you saw in problem set 6, you can search such a graph if you can
keep track of where you have already been.  You also need a bit
more-see tutorial exercise 5.  Hint: You may want to look at the
procedure <TT>reverse-exit</TT> in the file <TT>search-rooms.scm</TT>.
<P>
Rather than searching the humdrum world of building NE43, you are to
explore a magic labyrinth.  If you enter the labyrinth unprepared, you
are very likely to get very lost, because all the rooms have the same
name and the same description.
<P>
You can explore the labyrinth using the same method you learned about
in problem set 6.  Namely, you can do a graph traversal, marking where
you've been.  Recall that exercise 6 implemented the marking by means
of <TT>make-mark-procedures</TT>, which we used to construct two
procedures, one for testing whether we've already visited a place, and
one to mark the place as visited:
<P>

<PRE>(define mark-procedures (make-mark-procedures))
(define deja-vu? (car mark-procedures))
(define note-visited! (cadr mark-procedures))</PRE>

<P>
You'll find <TT>make-mark-procedures</TT> supplied for you in the file
<TT>search-rooms.scm</TT>.  By applying <TT>deja-vu?</TT> and <TT>
note-visited!</TT> to your location as you walk around, you should be able
to search the labyrinth without getting terribly lost.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SECTION00051010000000000000">Computer exercise 2:</A></H4>
<P>
Reinitialize the world for this exercise by running <TT>
(start-exercise-2 &lt;<EM>your name</EM>&gt;)</TT>.  It makes the same NE43 world,
with the addition of a randomly constructed labyrinth of twisty little
passages, all alike.  This labyrinth is accessible through an exit,
constructed at the location of the avatar, called <TT>Dis</TT>.
Somewhere in the labyrinth there is a thing named <TT>diamond</TT>.  You
should be able to use your mark procedures to help you find the
diamond and bring it back into the world of NE43.  In point of fact,
the maze we construct here is very small.  We don't want you to get
lost--yet!  So it is likely you'll quickly stumble across the
diamond, even without a search strategy.  But use the marks anyway,
because you'll need to understand how this works for the rest of this
problem set.  Turn in a transcript showing a record of your activity
in exploring the labyrinth.

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00052000000000000000">Dropping pebbles</A></H2>
<P>
The mark procedures we provided for you in exercise 2 maintain a list
of (pointers to) the rooms you've visited.  But this is unrealistic,
even in our fantasy magic world: What is the physical interpretation
of carrying around a list of rooms to compare with your current
location?  (Does <TT>eq?</TT>  make sense in the ``real world''?)  To be
more realistic, we should mark the rooms in some other way.  For
example, when we enter a room, we can drop some object that we can
later recognize if we ever return to the room.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SECTION00052010000000000000">Computer exercise 3:</A></H4>
<P>
Define a new class of object called a <TT>pebble</TT>, and define a new
version of <TT>make-mark-procedures</TT> such that <TT>note-visited!</TT>
works by constructing a pebble and dropping it at the place being
visited.  The associated procedure <TT>deja-vu?</TT> checks to see if a
pebble is present in the room visited.  The pebble should be a new
subclass of <TT>thing</TT>.
<P>
Notice that two searches will be confused if we cannot distinguish the
pebbles used in the first search from the pebbles used in the second
search.  A simple way to deal with this is to name all the pebbles
used in a given search with a fixed number, but to use different
numbers for different searches (like using different colored pebbles
for each search).  The number must be incremented each time a search
is begun (when <TT>make-mark-procedures</TT> allocates the name).  Walk
the avatar around NE43, dropping pebbles and recognizing them when you
encounter them.  (Hint: Look through <TT>objtypes.scm</TT> to see how new
classes of objects are defined.  Observe that for each class there is
a <TT>make</TT> procedure, and an associated <TT>construct</TT> procedure,
which is the procedure you call to actually construct the object.
Also note that you should make your objects respond to a <TT>PEBBLE?</TT>
message, so that you can use <TT>is-a</TT> to identify these as pebbles.)

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00053000000000000000">A robotic assistant</A></H2>
<P>
You can now use your pebbles to search the labyrinth.  But you do not
want to do this for large labyrinth.  Instead, you can program your
robot to do the searching for you.  Of course, you have to construct a
robot before you can use it.  Look at the definition of the <TT>
robot</TT> object in <TT>objtypes.scm</TT>, to see how robots are constructed
in general.  Then, look at the procedure <TT>start-robot-searching!</TT>
in <TT>search-rooms.scm</TT> to see how to the robot's program gets
coupled to the search strategy.
<P>
Look at the procedure <TT>setup-robot</TT> at the end of the file <TT>
search-rooms.scm</TT> to see how to construct a robot and start it up.
The existing <TT>setup-robot</TT> program will find the object called
<TT>the-goal</TT>, just as you did in computer exercise 1.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SECTION00053010000000000000">Computer exercise 4:</A></H4>
<P>
Play with the robot a bit.  Reinitialize the simulation with
<TT>(setup &lt;<EM>your name</EM>&gt;)</TT> and run the robot until it finds <TT>
the-goal</TT>.  Do this with <TT>*deity-mode*</TT> true and also false so you
can see how the robot is working.  Now try <TT>(start-exercise-4
&lt;<I>your name</I>&gt;)</TT>, set up the robot to find the <TT>diamond</TT> (which
is somewhere in the labyrinth) than <TT>the-goal</TT>) and observe how
this works.  There is nothing to turn in for this exercise.

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00054000000000000000">Finding something of real value</A></H2>
<P>
For the next  part of your  adventure, you will search  the maze for a
truly valuable object:  a magic scroll.  If  you can get your hands on
the scroll, you can learn  a magic word that  you can use to get extra
points   on  Quiz   2.   (We're not   kidding!)   This   magic word is
personalized  to   you:   Each student  will   get   a different magic
word.<A NAME="tex2html2" HREF="footnode.html#285"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://swissnet.ai.mit.edu/latex2html-lib/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A>
<P>
The magic scroll will be hidden inside a new labyrinth, which is a lot
larger than the one for exercises 3 and 4.  There are also a few
characters that wander aimlessly through the labyrinth, and do nothing
in particular.  You <EM>might</EM> be able to search this labyrinth by
hand, but we don't recommend trying.  Instead, you should use a robot
to perform the search.
<P>
There is, however, a catch.<A NAME="tex2html3" HREF="footnode.html#287"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://swissnet.ai.mit.edu/latex2html-lib/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A> The magic scroll will work only in Jill's office.  So it's not
enough to just send the robot searching for the scroll.  You'll have
to modify the robot's program so that it not only finds the scroll,
but brings it back to you so you can take it to Jill's office to read
it.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SECTION00054010000000000000">Computer exercise 5:</A></H4>
<P>
Reinitialize the the world for this exercise by running <TT>
(start-exercise-5 &lt;<I>your name</I>&gt;)</TT>.  This creates a large labyrinth
with the magic scroll hidden in it.  The magic scroll is a new kind of
object of class <TT>scroll</TT> (so that it responds to the <TT>SCROLL?</TT>
message), and whose name is <TT>magic-scroll</TT>.  Reprogram the robot
to venture into the labyrinth and retrieve the scroll for you.  Take
the scroll to Jill's office and ask the scroll to <TT>read</TT>, and
follow the instructions.  If all works well, you'll obtain the magic
word.  You'll need to have your MIT ID number handy.  Caution: You can
read the scroll only once.  After that, its magic will be used up.
Keep your magic word for the quiz, but turn in your modified robot
program for this exercise.
<P>
<B>Warning:</B> Like all things magical, the scroll must be handled
with great care.  It is content to be handled by a robot or an avatar.
But if you try to ``cheat'' by ordering the scroll to move directly,
the scroll's magic will be destroyed and you will have to restart the
problem.

Suppose we had a poltergeist, who randomly wanders around the
labyrinth.  The poltergeist picks up objects that are not <TT>owned</TT>
and drops them in other places.  Would your search robot work if the
world included a poltergeist?  If you think it would, explain.  If you
think it would not, explain.  Does it make a difference to your answer
whether pebbles are constructed as a subclass of <TT>thing</TT> vs. as a
subclass of <TT>named-object</TT>?  You need not provide a running

Having read through to code for this problem set, you've seen that
there are lots of possibilities to extend the world with new kinds of
objects. (See, for example, the <TT>troll</TT> implementation in <TT>
objtypes.scm</TT>.)  Create a world of your own, with some novel
characters and an interesting story line.  Include a short narrative
description of your work.  We will award prizes for the most
interesting stories combined with the cleverest technical ideas.  Note
that it is more impressive to implement a simple, elegant idea than to
amass a pile of characters and places.
