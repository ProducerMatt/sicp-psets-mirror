<P>
The second problem that we need to solve is to determine
how long to keep recursing. Equivalently, we can ask ``what
is the base case?'' which we want our code to check for.
The answer to that stems from the relationship between the
recursion we are making and the GCD algorithm described in
the book in section 1.2.5.
<P>
In that section, it is noted that ``It is possible to show
that starting with any two positive integers and performing
repeated reductions will always eventually produce a pair 
where the second number is 0''. So this means that if we
keep on recursing we will reach a point where we will be trying
to solve an equation with b=0, since b is the ``second
number'' in our case.
<P>
When b=0, what will ``a'' be? Since we are also assuming in 
this exercise that a and b have GCD = 1, it must mean 
a=1 when b=0.
<P>
Consequently, at this point in the recursion, we will really
be trying to solve an equation x = 1, for which the
answer is trivial!. The procedure returns a list where the
value of x is 1, and the value of y can be anything you 
want. (The fact that y can be anything is related to the
fact that ax+by = 1 define a line.) In our case, we choose
the value of y to be 0.
