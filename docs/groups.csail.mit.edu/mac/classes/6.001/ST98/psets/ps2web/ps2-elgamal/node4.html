Begin by loading the code for problem set 2, using the Edwin command
<TT>M-x load problem set</TT>.
<P>
<B>Note on debugging procedures that use randomness:</B> Many of the
procedures you will be working with this assignment depend on selecting
random numbers, and so will give different answers each time you run
them.  Such procedures can be confusing to debug, since it's hard to
tell whether things are changing due to your modifications or just due
to selecting different random numbers.  To help you in debugging,
we've provided a procedure <TT>reset-random!</TT> (which takes no
arguments).  Whenever you run <TT>(reset-random!)</TT> the random number
generator will be returned to its initial state.  This permits you to
do repeatable experiments.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SECTION00040010000000000000">Computer exercise 1:</A></H4>
 Implement the <TT>decrypt</TT> procedure,
which takes as arguments an encrypted message and a key system and
produces the unencrypted message (assuming the key system is the
correct one for decrypting the message).  For testing your procedure,
we've provided a key-system <TT>ks-ex-1</TT> and a test encrypted
message, <TT>enc-message-ex-1</TT>.  Turn in a listing
of your procedure and demonstrate that you can decrypt the message.

 Define the procedures <TT>find-generator</TT>
and <TT>choose-safe-prime</TT>, which you wrote for tutorial exercise 1.
Test them by finding a safe prime (use size equal to 5) and a
generator for it.  Once you think this is working, you should be able
to run the procedure <TT>generate-key-system</TT>.  Generate a key system
and the corresponding public key.  Demonstrate that you can use the
public key to encrypt messages and then use the key system to decrypt
them.

 How long does it take to crack the ElGamal
system?  To help you determine this, we've included a procedure called
<TT>timed</TT>, which, if you place at the beginning of a combination,
will evaluate the rest of the combination (as if the <TT>timed</TT>
weren't there) and return the value along with the time required for
the evaluation.  Thus, evaluating 

<PRE>(timed crack-public-key pk)</PRE>

will apply the procedure <TT>crack-public-key</TT> to the argument <TT>
pk</TT> (or whatever argument you want to use) and return the result,
together with the time (in seconds) required to do the computation.
Crack some public keys of size 4.  Remember that all the random
choices will result in a wide range of results, but you should be able
to get some sort of average time.  How do you expect the time to crack
the key to grow as the size of the prime increases?  Suppose you had a
million times the computational resources that you are now using in
working on this problem set, and that all these resources could be
dedicated to cracking a single key.  How long would it take to crack a
key of size 50?  Of size 100?  Give your answer in seconds, minutes,
days, or years, whichever seems most appropriate.

<P>
The Dean's office is working on better security, but due to
reengineering, they have been unable to issue public keys of size
greater than 5.  William's public key and the above cipher-text are
defined for you as <TT>pk-ex-7</TT> and <TT>secret-ex-7</TT>.  Crack the key
and decrypt the message.  It sounds ominous, doesn't it?  (Be patient
in cracking the key, which may take a minute or two.  Note that this
is a longer key than the ones you cracked in exercise 6.)

<P>
<OL>
<LI> About how much time did you spend on this homework assignment?
(Reading and preparing the assignment plus computer work.)
<LI> Which scheme system(s) did you use to do this assignment (for
example: 6.001 lab, your own NT machine, your own Win95 machine, your
own Linux machine)?
<LI>
We encourage you to work with others on problem sets as long as you
acknowledge it (see the 6.001 General Information handout).
<UL>
<LI> If you cooperated with other students, LA's, or others, or found portions
of your answers for this problem set in references other than the
text (such as some of the archives), please indicate your
consultants' names and your references.  Also,
explicitly label all text and code you are submitting which is the same as
that being submitted by one of your collaborators.
<LI> Otherwise, write ``I worked alone using only the reference
materials,'' and sign your statement.
