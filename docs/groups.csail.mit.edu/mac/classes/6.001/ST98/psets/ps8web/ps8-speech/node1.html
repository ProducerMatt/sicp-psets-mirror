<P>
In this problem set, you will experiment with an idealized system for
speech-recognition, with the primary aim of seeing how stream
processing can be a powerful tool for manipulating certain kinds of
data.  We are going to make several simplifying assumptions (after
all, we don't really expect you to build a state-of-the-art speech
recognition system in one week).
<P>
First, we'll not worry about converting actual sounds to phonemes.
Instead, we'll use a program that simulates the operation of a
``front end'' to the speech processor by taking a stream of symbols
that represent phonemes and putting out a stream of results.  Since
speech signals are noisy, our simulation will produce, for each input
``phoneme'' a list of possible phonemes this ``sounds like,'' together
with a probability that this is the actual phoneme that was ``heard.''
For example, the front end might determine that a phoneme is either an
``s'' with probability .8, or an ``sh'' with probability .15, or a
``c'' with probability .05.  Our simulator will include a parameter
that reflects the amount of noise--phoneme identification becomes less
reliable as the noise increases.
<P>
Our second simplification is that we'll assume that the ordinary
English spelling of words can be used as their phonetic spelling
(which is false).  In the speech-recognition community, phonemes
correspond to specific speech sounds, and they are notated in a system like
the International Phonetic alphabet.  To keep things simple, we will
approximate this by using substrings of words as phonemes.  Thus, the
word ``finish'' might be represented by the sequence ``f'' ``i'' ``n''
``i'' ``sh''.  Overall, we'll use the following set of ``phonemes'':
<P>

<PRE>a b c ch d e ee f h i j k l ll m n o p qu r s sh ss t th u v w wh x y z</PRE>

<P>
The following table shows, for our simple model, which phonemes can
get mistaken for other phonemes by our (simulated) front-end processor:
<P>

<PRE>(define *confusion-list*
  '((a o u) (b p d t g) (c k ch t) (ch s sh) (d th) (e i o a) (ee i o a) (f v)
    (g j ch) (h wh) (i e a o) (j g) (k c) (l r) (ll r) (m n) (n m) (o a)
    (p b t d) (qu k) (r l) (s sh) (sh s ch) (ss sh ch) (t d b p) (th d b p)
    (u o) (v f) (w u) (wh h) (x z s) (y i) (z s x)))</PRE>

<P>
The interpretation of this table is that an input ``a'' could be heard
as an ``a'' or an ``o'' or a ``u''; an input ``b'' as a ``b'', ``p'',
``d'', ``t'', or ``g'', and so on.
<P>
Our third and most important simplifying assumption is to assume that
individual words in the input stream are clearly separated by
silences, which we'll notate in the input stream by stars.  Thus,
the phrase ``the cat looked at the fish'' would appear as input to the
font-end processor as
<P>

<PRE>th e * c a t * l oo k e d * a t * th e * f i sh</PRE>

<P>
In accordance with <TT>*confusion-list*</TT>, the front-end processor
would report that the first phoneme is ``th'' or ``d'' or ``b'' or
``p'', the second phoneme is ``e'' or ``i'' or ``o'' or ``a'', and so
on.  Observe that these confusions are unrealistic: we'd do much
better if we used real phonetic spellings.
<P>
In order to disambiguate the possible phoneme choices produced by the
front end, our system will need to know which sequences of phonemes
correspond to sounds.  To do this, we'll use a dictionary that gives
the ``phonetic spellings'' of common words.  In our simplified
approach, the phonetic spelling is the same as the real spelling, so
to look up a sequence of phonemes, we'll concatenate the phonemes and
see if this produces a word in the dictionary, which is a list of
about a thousand common English words.
<P>
Our goal in this problem is to use these components to produce a
system that can decode a noisy stream of phonemes into words and thus
recognize what is being ``said.''
