<h2 align=center>Final Exam announcement</h2>

<h2 align=center>Issued Tuesday, May 5, 1998</h2>


The 6.001 final will be held on Monday afternoon, May 18th, from
1:30-4:30 in the Athletic Center.  Conflict exams must be scheduled
through the Registrar's office.  If you have a conflict with this
time, contact the Registrar's Office, <em>not the 6.001 staff</em>.
There are no excused absences from the final.  If you miss the final,
the only passing grade you can receive for the course is "O", and
you will have to resolve this through the dean's office.

<p>

The final will be open book and open notes.

<p>

<strong>End-of-term grades</strong> for 6.001 will be available
beginning on Thursday, May 21st, in NE43-430.  You must come in
person and give proof of your identity.  We will not give out grades
over the phone.  Also, the Course 6 undergraduate office will not give
out grades---please don't phone them to ask.  Graded final
examinations will not be returned, but they may be reviewed in
NE43-430.

<p>

In order to help you review for the final, we distributed a copy of
an old final in lecture on May 5.  It will show you the sorts of
questions you should expect.  Note that this old exam was closed book,
while this semester's final will be open book.

<p>

This old exam doesn't cover some of the newer material we included
this semester: topics like cryptography, intellectual property,
concurrency, Halting Theorem, and so on.  All of these may appear on
the final, so you should review your lecture notes on this material,
and also look at the corresponding microquizzes, which you can find on
the 6.001 web page.  We also suggest that you review your problem
sets, since some of the final questions will assume familiarity with
the programming assignments.  You may also want to bring your problem
sets with you to the exam.


<p>

If you missed lecture that day, you can find copies of the old final
outside Becky Bisbee's office at NE43-430.
