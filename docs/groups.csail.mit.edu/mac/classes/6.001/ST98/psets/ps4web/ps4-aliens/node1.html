<P>
Each incoming freshthing has preferences for his/her/its living space.
For example, the atmosphere should have the correct composition and
the temperature range should be correct.  There are other kinds of
preferences, such as the desirable spectral range of electromagnetic
radiation in which the freshthing sees, and the diurnal phase that is
appropriate for its work or study.
<P>
Some kinds of preferences are more important than others.  For example,
having a roommate who prefers to be awake when you are asleep is merely
annoying, but having to room with someone who breathes an atmosphere
that is poisonous to you would be rather more problematic.  We will
therefore organize the preferences into categories and specify an
order of importance to the categories.  Every freshthing will pick
housing preferences in each category.  The categories, in order of
importance, and the initial possible choices are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> <B>Atmosphere:</B> methane, oxygen, sulfur, ethanol, etc.
<LI> <B>Temperature:</B> 350K-370K, 290K-300K, 260K-270K, etc.
<LI> <B>Spectrum:</B> infrared, visible, ultraviolet, etc.
<LI> <B>Cycle:</B> day, night, random, etc.
<P>
</UL>
<P>
When a new freshthing interacts with the Housing Office, he/she/it
indicates preferences for items in this list.  A freshthing may list
as many preferences as it wishes, but it may not list a preference in
a category without listing preferences in all the categories that are
more important.  For example, it might list <EM>(methane, 260K-270K,
infrared, random)</EM>, or <EM>(oxygen, 290K-300K, visible)</EM>, or <EM>
(sulfur, 350K-370K, ultraviolet)</EM>.  But it may not list <EM>(sulfur,
ultraviolet)</EM>, because that skips temperature, which is more important
than spectrum.
<P>
Our goal is to implement a system that will take all the preferences
from the incoming class, group together those students with similar
needs, then use the results to figure out which students to group
together and how much reconstruction of Random Hall will be required
to convert rooms to the appropriate environments.
<P>
In order to keep track of the preferences, we will use a data
structure called an <EM>association table</EM>.  Such a table associates
a sequence of keys with a list of values.  In our application, the
sequence of keys will be the preferences specified, and the
list of values will the the list of freshthings who specified exactly
those preferences.
<P>
We can regard such a table as a tree, as shown in
figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node1.html#figtree">1</A>.  Each node of the tree (indicated by black dots
in the figure) designates a list of values (indicated by boxes in the
figure).  The key sequence to access any of the lists of values in the
tree are the labels on the edges of the tree as we move from the root
to the appropriate node.
<P>
For example, in figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node1.html#figtree">1</A>, if we follow the sequence of
keys (<EM>methane</EM>, <EM>260K-270K</EM>), we find that the freshthing
named Hexapod4 requires a methane atmosphere and a temperature range
of of 260K-270K.  If we extend the key sequence to be (<EM>methane</EM>,
p<EM>260K-270K</EM>, <EM>infrared</EM>), there is no freshthing who has
exactly that set of preferences (as represented by the empty box). But
if we extend the sequence further to be (<EM>methane</EM>, <EM>
260K-270K</EM>, <EM>infrared</EM>, <EM>random</EM>), we find that these are the
preferences for Hexapod1 and Hexapod2.  Similarly, we can examine the
branch for freshthings who require a sulfur atmosphere, or oxygen, or
ethanol.  Note the empty box at the top of the tree, which signifies
that there are no freshthings who have expressed no preferences
(although expressing no preferences would be an OK thing to do).

We will represent tables using list structure.  A table is a list
whose first element is the list of values at the node at the top of
the table and whose remaining elements are the branches emanating from
that node.  To make an empty table, we use empty lists for the keys
and the branches:
<P>

<PRE>(define (make-table values list-of-branches)
  (cons values list-of-branches))

(define table-values car)
(define table-branches cdr)

(define (make-empty-table)
  (make-table '() '()))</PRE>
<P>
A branch is a pair consisting of a key (the label on the branch) and a
subtable (the node that the branch connects to):
<P>

<PRE>(define (make-branch key subtable)
  (cons key subtable))

(define branch-key car)
(define branch-subtable cdr)</PRE>
<P>
The essential building block in our system is a method for adding
a new value to a table, associating it with a specified sequence of keys:

<PRE>(define (add-to-table val table keys)
  (if (null? keys)          
      ;; keys ran out so insert new value here.
      (make-table (cons val (table-values table))
                  (table-branches table))
      ;; more keys to go, so descend deeper into tree.
      (make-table (table-values table)  
                  (insert-in-branches val 
                                     (table-branches table) 
                                     keys))))</PRE>
<P>
The subprocedure <TT>insert-in-branches</TT> checks the list of branches
to find the one with the right key (i.e., the first key in the
sequence), and adds the value to the structure for that branch:
<P>

<PRE>;; Assumes there is at least one key
;; Search the branches looking for a match on the first key.
;; Return the new list of branches with the appropriate subtable augmented. 
(define (insert-in-branches val branches keys)
  (cond ((null? branches)
         ;; Make a new list with one new branch.
         (list
          (make-branch (car keys) 
                       (add-to-table val
                                     (make-empty-table)
                                     (cdr keys)))))
        ((eq? (car keys) (branch-key (car branches)))
         ;; found the right branch to augment: Add the value to
         ;; the subtable for that branch
         (cons
          (make-branch (branch-key (car branches))
                       (add-to-table val
                                     (branch-subtable (car branches))
                                     (cdr keys)))
          (cdr branches)))
        (else (cons (car branches)
                    (insert-in-branches val (cdr branches) keys)))))</PRE>
<P>
Notice the (tricky!) intertwined recursive structure here: <TT>
add-to-table</TT> calls <TT>insert-in-branches</TT> to insert the element
into the appropriate branch; <TT>insert-in-branches</TT> calls <TT>
add-to-table</TT> to insert the element into the subtable for the
appropriate branch.
<P>
The following procedure begins with a list of freshthings and their
preferences (assumed in correct order and not skipping any) and builds
up an association table, installing the freshthings one by one:
<P>

<PRE>(define (install table things)
  ;; things is a list of freshthings
  ;; each is a list of name and a list of attributes
  (cond ((null? things)
         table)
        (else
         (install (add-to-table (car (car things))
                                table
                                (cadr (car things)))
                  (cdr things)))))</PRE>
<P>
For example, our initial galactic entering class of 1998 might be:
<P>

<PRE>(define entering-class
  (install (make-empty-table)
           '((hexapod1 (methane 260K-270K infrared random))
             (hexapod2 (methane 260K-270K infrared random))
             (hexapod3 (methane 260K-270K infrared night))
             (hexapod4 (methane 260K-270K))
             (amoeboid1 (sulfur 350K-370K))
             (amoeboid2 (sulfur 350K-370K ultraviolet random))
             (amoeboid3 (sulfur 350K-370K ultraviolet random))
             (amoeboid4 (sulfur 350K-370K visible day))
             (gnork (ethanol 290K-300K))
             (gnorkette (ethanol 290K-300K ultraviolet))
             (snork (ethanol 290k-300k))
             (tork (ethanol 260K-270K))
             (bork (ethanol 260K-270K))
             (fred (oxygen 290K-300K visible))
             (mary (oxygen 290K-300K visible day))
             (mike (oxygen 290K-300K)))))</PRE>
<P>
The resulting structure, printed as a list is:

<PRE>(()
 (methane ()
          (260k-270k (hexapod4)
                     (infrared ()
                               (random (hexapod2 hexapod1))
                               (night (hexapod3)))))
 (sulfur ()
         (350k-370k (amoeboid1)
                    (ultraviolet ()
                                 (random (amoeboid3 amoeboid2)))
                    (visible ()
                             (day (amoeboid4)))))
 (ethanol ()
          (290k-300k (snork gnork)
                     (ultraviolet (gnorkette)))
          (260k-270k (bork tork)))
 (oxygen ()
         (290k-300k (mike)
                    (visible (fred)
                             (day (mary))))))</PRE>
<P>
This is in fact the table shown in figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node1.html#figtree">1</A>, with the
branches for the ethanol and oxygen breathers included.
