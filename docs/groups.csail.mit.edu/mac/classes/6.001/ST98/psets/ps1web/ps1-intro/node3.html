<P>
Now that you have gained some experience with Scheme,
you are ready to work on the programming assignment.  When you are finished
with this section write up and hand in the numbered
computer exercises below.  Take a look on the web site, in the problem
sets section, at the information labeled by
<A NAME="tex2html7" HREF="http://swissnet.ai.mit.edu/6.001/writeup.html">``How
should I write up my problem
set?''</A> to see what we
are looking for.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00031000000000000000">Shading patterns</A></H2>
<P>
Scheme comes with many built-in primitive procedures, including simple
numeric procedures such as <TT>sin</TT> and <TT>cos</TT> which take as
argument a number in radians, and return the sine and cosine of that
argument respectively.  One way to visualize numeric procedures is to
graph them as functions of their arguments.  For one-argument
procedures, one can use ordinary graphs.  For
two-argument procedures, it is often convenient to display the values
as pictures.  That is, we can let <I>b</I>(<I>x</I>,<I>y</I>) be interpreted as a brightness value,
and then create a two-dimensional display showing the value of <I>b</I> as
a brightness pattern.
<P>
In this problem set, we'll play with these two-dimensional
graphs.<A NAME="tex2html8" HREF="footnode.html#239"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://swissnet.ai.mit.edu/latex2html-lib/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A>  We have provided you with some
utilities.  When you load this problem set (using <TT>M-x
load-problem-set</TT>), the system will create three graphics display
windows on your screen and give them the names <TT>g1, g2</TT> and <TT>
g3</TT>.  Each window is 128 wide and 128 high: the points in the
window have integer <I>x</I> and <I>y</I> coordinates that range between 0 and
127.  (These are ``logical coordinates''--the physical size of the
window in pixels may be different from <IMG WIDTH=72 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline709" SRC="img2.gif">.)
<P>
You can display pictures with the <TT>picture-display</TT> procedure,
which takes two arguments: a window and a picture.  <TT>
Picture-display</TT> finds the minimum and maximum values in the picture,
scales those values so that the minimum value appears as black and the
maximum as white, and then displays the result in the window.  You can
supply two additional optional arguments to <TT>picture-display</TT> that
set the minimum and maximum display values: any value in the picture
below the specified minimum will be displayed as black; any value in
the picture above the specified maximum will be displayed as white.
<P>
One way to create a picture is as the ``graph'' of a two-argument
function, using

<PRE> (procedure-&gt;picture x y b)</PRE> 
Here <TT>x</TT> and <TT>y</TT> specify the width and height of the picture
to be created. <TT>x</TT> and <TT>y</TT> must be integers, and <TT>b</TT> must
be a function of two arguments, whose values will be used to create
the picture.  For example, evaluating 
<PRE>(picture-display g1 (procedure-&gt;picture 128 128 +))</PRE>

will fill window <TT>g1</TT> with a shaded gray pattern whose brightness
at each point (<I>x</I>,<I>y</I>) is <I>x</I>+<I>y</I>.  Thus, the brightness increases
uniformly as you move diagonally from black near (0,0) to white near
(128,128).
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SECTION00031010000000000000">Computer exercise 1:</A></H4>
 Draw a shaded pattern (a) that
looks like the one above, only upside down; (b) where the brightness
increases uniformly as you move horizontally from left to right; (c)
where the brightness increases uniformly as you move outwards from the
center of the window.  Turn in the expressions you evaluated to obtain
each pattern.  There are lots of different correct answers to this
problem.

<P>
Creating a simple cosine grating: Use a procedure of two arguments
whose returned value is the cosine of the second argument,
transform that to a picture, and display the result:

<PRE>(define pic1 (procedure-&gt;picture 128 128 (lambda (x y) (cos y))))

 <B>Note on naming pictures:</B> Whenever you create a picture, you
use up memory space. If you give the picture a name using <TT>
define</TT>, that space cannot be reused, and if you create and name too
many pictures, you may fill up Scheme's memory.  It is a good idea to
only use a few names for pictures and reuse these names as needed.
For example, we could just use <TT>pic1, pic2</TT> and <TT>pic3</TT>.
<P>

 The code above creates a cosine
grating of a particular width.  To change the width,

specifies the frequency of the cosine wave.  Define a procedure
called <TT>cosine-y-grate</TT> that takes <I>f</I> as an argument and returns
the appropriate cosine grating.  If your procedure is defined
correctly, you ought to be able to evaluate:

<PRE>(picture-display g2 (cosine-y-grate .3))</PRE>

to draw a wide-spaced grating in window <TT>g2</TT>.  Turn in your

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00033000000000000000">Operations on pictures</A></H2>
<P>
We've provided a procedure called <TT>picture-map</TT> that enables you
to operate on pictures and to combine pictures.  You use it as follows:

<PRE>(picture-map proc picture1 picture2 ... picturen)</PRE>

Here <TT>proc</TT> is some procedure of <I>n</I> arguments, and <TT>picture1,
picture2, ..., picturen</TT> are <I>n</I> pictures, all of the same size.  The
result is a new picture, where each value in the picture is the result
of applying <TT>proc</TT> to the corresponding values of the <I>n</I>
pictures.  For example, if <TT>pic</TT> is a picture, then

<PRE>(picture-map (lambda (val) (- val)) pic)</PRE>

returns a picture whose values are the negatives of the values of <TT>pic</TT>;
and if <TT>pic1</TT> and <TT>pic2</TT> are pictures, then 

<PRE>(picture-map + pic1 pic2)</PRE>

returns a picture whose value at each point (<I>x</I>,<I>y</I>) is the sum of the
corresponding values of <TT>pic1</TT> and <TT>pic2</TT> (i.e., the
superposition of the two pictures).
<P>
<TT>Picture-map</TT> illustrates an important concept called <EM>
operating on aggregates</EM>, namely, the idea of expressing operations
directly in terms of compound data structures, rather than in terms of
the individual components of those structures.  We'll look at this
idea in detail later in the semester, starting with lecture on
February 24.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SECTION00033010000000000000">Computer exercise 5:</A></H4>
 Define a procedure that takes two
arguments <IMG WIDTH=14 HEIGHT=25 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline741" SRC="img5.gif"> and <IMG WIDTH=14 HEIGHT=25 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline743" SRC="img6.gif"> and returns a picture whose value at (<I>x</I>,<I>y</I>)
is <IMG WIDTH=107 HEIGHT=25 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline747" SRC="img7.gif">.  Define the procedure two different ways: (a)
directly in terms of the point values, using <TT>procedure-&gt;picture</TT>;
(b) using <TT>picture-map</TT> together with your answers to exercises
2 and 3.  Be sure to draw the pictures produced by the two
methods to confirm that they give the same result.

<P>
A second way of getting pictures into your
system, rather than constructing them from numeric functions, is to
load some previously stored pictures.  If you evaluate:
<P>
<PRE>(define pic1 (pgm-file-&gt;picture &quot;fovnder.pgm&quot;))</PRE>

you'll get a picture of William Barton Rogers, the beloved <font size=-1><small>FOVNDER</small></font> and first president of MIT.  He looks pretty dour, doesn't
he?  Maybe you can improve his disposition by combining him with some
of your sinusoidal gratings from the previous exercises.  Try this.

<P>
We're sure you've heard the rumors floating around campus that,
despite repeated denials, the MIT
administration has a secret plan to require all freshmen to live on
campus beginning next fall, which they will announce later this
spring.  The 6.001 staff has a mole in the office of the Dean of
Undergraduate Education, and--the rumors may very well be true!
According to our information, Dean Rozz Williams is about to appoint a
new Director of Freshman Housing.  We've even obtained a
picture that her office has constructed of the ideal candidate.  The
picture appears in figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node3.html#figmix">1</A>, and you can get a copy of it
by evaluating
<P>
<PRE>(define pic1 (pgm-file-&gt;picture &quot;mix-sp98.pgm&quot;))</PRE>

The word is that the new Freshman Housing Director must be a perfect
blend--someone who can really empathize with the incoming students,
and yet be tough enough to handle all the flack.  You can see,
however, that the picture is still foggy (perhaps a reflection of
the state of the housing policy?).  To decode the picture you need to
understand how it was made.

<STRONG>Figure 1:</STRONG> MIT's ideal Director of Freshman Housing<BR>
<P>
<P>
Consider two functions <I>a</I>(<I>x</I>,<I>y</I>) and <I>b</I>(<I>x</I>,<I>y</I>).  We can
create a combined function
known as a <EM>convex blend</EM> by using
<BR><IMG WIDTH=377 HEIGHT=17 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="displaymath749" SRC="img9.gif"><BR>
Typically <I>r</I> is a constant, but we can make it a function of <I>x</I> and
<I>y</I> as well:
<BR><IMG WIDTH=417 HEIGHT=17 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="displaymath750" SRC="img10.gif"><BR>
In this way, we can blend two pictures <I>a</I> and <I>b</I> to
create a new picture <I>c</I>.
<P>
In general, knowing the values of <I>r</I>(<I>x</I>,<I>y</I>) and <I>c</I>(<I>x</I>,<I>y</I>) is not enough
to allow us to recover <I>a</I>(<I>x</I>,<I>y</I>) or <I>b</I>(<I>x</I>,<I>y</I>).  But there are particular
choices for <I>r</I> for which we can recover the original unblended functions.
Suppose we choose <I>r</I> to be a sinusoidal grating
<BR><IMG WIDTH=356 HEIGHT=35 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="displaymath751" SRC="img11.gif"><BR>
where <I>f</I> is a frequency and <I>t</I> is some function of <I>x</I> and <I>y</I>.  We
can take advantage of the structure of <I>r</I> to approximately recover
the original unblended functions.
<P>
In particular, suppose we want to recover as much of <I>a</I> as we can.
Notice that <I>r</I> takes on values between 0 and 1.  At places where <I>r</I>
is close to 0, there is not much of <I>a</I> in <I>c</I> (assuming that in
general <I>a</I> and <I>b</I> have roughly similar ranges of values).  On the
other hand, when <I>r</I> is close to 1, then <I>c</I> is mostly
<I>a</I>.  So if we could find a way to multiply points in <I>c</I> (which is
what we have our hands on) with values near 1 when <I>r</I> is near
1 and with values near 0 when <I>r</I> is near zero, then we could get
back a partial approximation to <I>a</I>.  But of course, this suggests
that we just multiply the values of <I>c</I> by <I>r</I> itself.
<P>
To verify this, 
write a procedure that prints the values of
<BR><IMG WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=118 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="eqnarray300" SRC="img12.gif"><BR>
for some sampled values of <I>u</I> between 0 and <IMG WIDTH=18 HEIGHT=12 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline839" SRC="img13.gif">.  You should
observe that when <I>r</I> is near 1, then <IMG WIDTH=14 HEIGHT=15 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline845" SRC="img14.gif"> is near 1 and <I>r</I>(1-<I>r</I>)
is near 0, and when <I>r</I> is near 0, both <IMG WIDTH=14 HEIGHT=15 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline845" SRC="img14.gif"> and <I>r</I>(1-<I>r</I>) are near
0.
<P>
As a consequence, if we can find the underlying sinusoidal grating
used to mix the two pictures, then by multiplying the mixture by the
grating, we should get back a result that is approximately one of the
original pictures: at points where <I>c</I> is mostly <I>a</I> we will get
approximately <I>a</I> as a result, and in places where <I>c</I> is mostly <I>b</I>,
we will get values near 0 as a result (i.e. a black picture).  If we
subtract that approximation from <I>c</I> we should get the other picture
<I>b</I>.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SECTION00035010000000000000">Computer exercise 6:</A></H4>
 Extract the two personalities who
blend to form the ideal freshman housing director, and see if you can
recognize who they are.  In order to do the extraction, you'll need to
identify the sinusoidal grating that was used to construct the
mixture.  As hint, we'll tell you that it really does use a grating
<I>r</I>(<I>x</I>,<I>y</I>) of the form described above, where <I>t</I>(<I>x</I>,<I>y</I>) is an appropriate
function (which you ought to be able to guess) and the frequency <I>f</I>
is a small integer multiple of 1/2.  (Note that this grating is not
exactly the gratings you created in the exercises above, since you
need to add one to the cosine and divide by 2.)  Turn in a two or
three sentence description of how you performed the extraction
together with any procedures you wrote to help you in the course of
doing so.<A NAME="tex2html10" HREF="footnode.html#413"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://swissnet.ai.mit.edu/latex2html-lib/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A>
