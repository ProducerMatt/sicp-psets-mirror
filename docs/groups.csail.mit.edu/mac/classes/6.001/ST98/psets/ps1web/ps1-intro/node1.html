<P>
The purpose of this section is to get you started using Scheme as
quickly as possible.  Start by looking at the subject web page labeled
<A NAME="tex2html3" HREF="http://swissnet.ai.mit.edu/6.001/using-scheme">``Using Scheme in 6.001''</A>.  You'll see there
that the 6.001 Scheme system runs in the 6.001 Lab (34-501), on PCs
running GNU/Linux, Windows NT4, or Windows 95 (sorry, no Macs or
Athena); and that you can move among the different implementations as
you require.  If you have a PC capable of running Scheme, we suggest
that you install it there, since it will be convenient for you to work
at home a lot of the time.  The 6.001 lab is probably the best place to
work if you want help, since that is staffed by knowledgeable and
friendly Lab Assistants.
<P>
Whether you're working with your machine or MIT's, the source of all
useful information is the 6.001 web page:

</B>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00011000000000000000">Starting scheme</A></H2>
<P>
The first thing to do is to get an implementation of Scheme and start
using it:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> <EM>In the 6.001 lab <IMG WIDTH=18 HEIGHT=2 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline693" SRC="img1.gif"></EM> A good way to get started
learning Scheme is to do this first section of the assignment in the
Lab, where there are LAs to help you, and then install Scheme on your
own PC and run through the section again to verify that your home
system works just like the one in the lab.  Find a free lab computer
and log in with the username <TT>u6001</TT>.  You will need to use a
floppy disk in order to save your files.<A NAME="tex2html4" HREF="footnode.html#151"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://swissnet.ai.mit.edu/latex2html-lib/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A>
<LI> <EM>On your home computer <IMG WIDTH=18 HEIGHT=2 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline693" SRC="img1.gif"></EM> follow the instructions on
the Web page for downloading and installing Scheme.  <EM>Important:</EM>
The version of Scheme we are using this spring--Scheme 7.5a--is not
the same version as the one used last fall. If you have an
installation from the fall, get a new one. Some of the problem sets
(PS2, for example) will not work on the old one.  Once you've
installed the Scheme system you should be able to simply start it and
do this part of the assignment.  If you are using your own computer,
you'll also have to download the code for each weekly assignment,
which you'll find on the web page.  You'll need to download the PS1
code for doing the later parts of this assignment, but don't worry
about that now.
<P>
</UL><H2><A NAME="SECTION00012000000000000000">Learning to use Edwin</A></H2>
<P>
In 6.001, we use a text-editing system called <EM>Edwin</EM>.  Edwin is a
implementation in Scheme of the Emacs text editor.  If you've used
Emacs before, you'll find Edwin virtually identical.  If you have never
used Emacs before (or even if you have) spend about 15 minutes going
through the on-line tutorial, which you start by typing <TT>C-h</TT>
followed by <TT>t</TT>.  (<TT>C-h</TT> means ``control-<TT>h</TT>'': to type
it, hold down the <font size=-1><small>CTRL</small></font> key and type <TT>h</TT>.  Release the <font size=-1><small>CTRL</small></font> key before typing <TT>t</TT>.)  You will probably get bored before
you finish the tutorial. (It's too long, anyway.)  But at least skim
all the topics so you know what's there.  You'll need to gain
reasonable facility with the editor in order to complete the problem
sets.<A NAME="tex2html5" HREF="footnode.html#411"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://swissnet.ai.mit.edu/latex2html-lib/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A>  To get out of the tutorial, type <TT>C-x k</TT>,
which will kill the buffer.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SECTION00012100000000000000">Evaluating expressions</A></H3>
<P>
After you have learned something about Edwin, go to the Scheme buffer
(i.e., the buffer named <TT>*scheme*</TT>).<A NAME="tex2html6" HREF="footnode.html#169"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://swissnet.ai.mit.edu/latex2html-lib/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A> As with any
buffer, you can type Scheme expressions, or any other text into this
buffer.  What distinguishes the Scheme buffer from other buffers is
the fact that underlying this buffer is a Scheme evaluator.
<P>
Scheme programming consists of writing and evaluating <EM>
expressions</EM>.  The simplest expressions are things like numbers.  More
complex arithmetic expressions consist of the name of an arithmetic
operator (things like +, -, *) followed by one or more other
expressions, all of this enclosed in parentheses.  So the Scheme
expression for adding 3 and 4 is <TT>(+ 3 4)</TT> rather than 3 +
4.
<P>
Try typing a simple expression such as

<PRE>1375</PRE>

Typing this expression inserts it into the buffer.  To ask Scheme to
evaluate it, we type <TT>C-x C-e</TT>, which causes the evaluator to read
the expression immediately preceding the cursor, evaluate it
(according to the kinds of rules described in lecture) and print out
the result.  Try this.
<P>
Numbers are boring expressions to evaluate, since the printed
representation of their value is the same as what you type.  To see
examples of evaluating more expressions, try these:

<PRE>-37

(- 8 9)

(&gt; 3.7 4.4)

(- (if (&gt; 3 4)
       7
       10)
   (/ 16 10))

(* (- 25 10)
   (+ 6 3))</PRE>

Observe that some of the examples printed above are indented and
displayed over several lines for readability.  An expression may be
typed on a single line or on several lines; the Scheme interpreter
ignores redundant spaces and line breaks.  It is to your
advantage to format your work so that you (and others) can read it
easily. It is also helpful in detecting errors introduced by
incorrectly placed parentheses.  For example the two expressions

<PRE>(* 5 (+ 2 (/ 4 2) (/ 8 3)))

(* 5 (+ 2 (/ 4 2)) (/ 8 3))</PRE>

<P>
look deceptively similar but have different values. Properly indented,
however, the difference is obvious.

<PRE>(* 5 
   (+ 2 
      (/ 4 2) 
      (/ 8 3)))

(* 5 
   (+ 2 
      (/ 4 2)) 
   (/ 8 3))</PRE>

<P>
Edwin provides several commands that ``pretty-print'' your code,
indenting lines to reflect the inherent structure of the Scheme
expressions (see Section B.2.1 of the <EM>Don't Panic</EM> manual).  Make
a habit of typing <TT>C-j</TT> at the end of a line, instead of <font size=-1><small>RETURN</small></font>, when you enter Scheme expressions, so that the automatic
indentation takes place.  <TT>Tab</TT> and <TT>M-q</TT> are other useful
Edwin formatting commands.
<P>
While the Scheme interpreter ignores redundant spaces and carriage returns,
it does not ignore redundant parentheses.  Try evaluating

<PRE>((+ 3 4))</PRE>

<P>
<H3><A NAME="SECTION00012200000000000000">Buffers and files</A></H3>
<P>
One could simply type all one's work into the <TT>*scheme*</TT> buffer,
but it is usually better to store versions of your code in a separate
buffer, which you can then save in a file.
<P>
The most convenient way to do this is to split the screen to show two
buffers at once--the \*scheme* buffer and a buffer for the file you
are constructing.  You will need know how to split the screen (<TT>
C-x 2</TT>) and how to move from one half to the other (<TT>C-x o</TT>).
<P>
Starting in the <TT>*scheme*</TT> buffer split the screen by typing
<TT>C-x 2</TT>.  At this point both halves of the screen will show the
same <TT>*scheme*</TT> buffer.  Now choose a file name ending with <TT>
.scm</TT> and type tt C-x C-f<EM>file name</EM>.  The half of the screen
you are in will now show a buffer for the new file.  You can type in
this buffer and evaluate expressions in this buffer.  The results will
appear in the <TT>*scheme*</TT> buffer.  If an error occurs during
evaluation you must go to the <TT>*scheme*</TT> buffer to deal with the
error.
<P>
To evaluate expressions, you can use any of several commands: you can
use <TT>C-x C-e</TT> to evaluate the expression preceding the cursor,
<TT>M-z</TT> to evaluate the current definition, or <TT>M-o</TT> to evaluate
the entire buffer (this does not work in the <TT>*scheme*</TT> buffer.
You may mark a region and use <TT>M-x eval-region</TT> to evaluate the
marked region.  Each of these commands will cause the Scheme evaluator
to evaluate the appropriate set of expressions.  Note that you can
type and evaluate expressions in either buffer, but the values will
always appear in the <TT>*scheme*</TT> buffer.  See the <EM>Don't Panic</EM>
manual for more details.
<P>
As a simple example create a new buffer called <TT>ps1-test.scm</TT>.
In this buffer create a definition for a simple procedure by typing
in the following (verbatim):

<PRE>(define square (lambda (x) (*x x)))</PRE>

Now evaluate this definition by using either <TT>M-z</TT> or <TT>C-x C-e</TT>.
Next try evaluating:
<P>

<PRE>square

(square 4)</PRE>

<P>
In fact, if you typed in the definition exactly as indicated above,
you should have hit an error at this point.  The system will now be
offering you a chance to enter the debugger.  For now, go to the <TT>
*scheme*</TT> buffer and type <TT>Q</TT> to quit the evaluation. (We'll
discuss the debugger below in section 4).  Go back to your <TT>
ps1-test.scm</TT> buffer, and edit the definition to insert a space
between <TT>*</TT> and <TT>x</TT>.  Re-evaluate the definition, and try
evaluating <TT>(square 4)</TT> again.
<P>
The system automagically maintains a special read-only buffer, called
<TT>*transcript*</TT>, which keeps a history of your interactions with
the Scheme evaluator.  You can extract pieces of this buffer to
document examples of your work for problem sets.  To go to this buffer
type <TT>C-x b *transcript*</TT>.  You can go back to any buffer with the
<TT>C-x b</TT> command.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00013000000000000000">Sending e-mail</A></H2>
<P>
That's it for this first part of the problem set, except for reporting
the results.  Compose an email message containing your definition of
square, together with an excerpt from the <TT>*transcript*</TT> buffer
showing that it works.  If you are using the 6.001 lab, typing <TT>
ctl-X m</TT> will open a mail buffer in which to compose your message.
The system will ask for your own email address, so the recipient will
know who sent the mail.
You may insert work by copying from other buffers.  To send your
completed message type <TT>ctl-C ctl-C</TT>.  If you're using your own
machine, you can save your work in a file and then mail this using
your favorite mailer.
<P>
Include in the message a brief, but warm
and enthusiastic greeting to your tutor and to your recitation
instructor.  As part of the message, say which Scheme implementation
you are using: 6001 Lab or your own machine (with which
operating system?).  If you don't know who your tutor and recitation
instructor are, look on the 6.001 web page.  The point here is not
only to make sure you can send mail, but also to enable your tutor to
add your email return address to the recitation section email list.
<P>
You can learn more about using Scheme in 6.001 from the <EM>Don't
Panic</EM> manual.  Also, at some point in the next couple of weeks, you
should go back and run the Edwin tutorial again, to see what you
glossed over the first time.
<P>
If you're a glutton for documentation, you can find an (almost)
complete description of Scheme commands in the <EM>Scheme Reference
Manual</EM>.  The <EM>Scheme User's Manual</EM> has some details on MIT
Scheme and Edwin.  The <EM>Revised Report on the Algorithmic Language
Scheme</EM> is the official (and not very readable) specification of the
Scheme language.  These documents are available on the web
page, and they are included with the Scheme implementations. But you
shouldn't need to look at any of them, because the material
will introduce new elements of Scheme as you need them.
