<H1><A NAME="SECTION00040000000000000000">4. The Debugging Tools</A></H1>
<P>
This next part of the problem set is a self-teaching exercise.  There
is nothing to turn in, and you do not need to do it right after
finishing part 3.  We suggest that you take a half hour to go through
this before you work on the next problem set.
<P>
During the semester, you will often need to debug programs.  This
section contains an exercise to acquaint you with some of the features
of Scheme to aid in debugging.  Learning to use the debugging features
will save you much grief on later problem sets.  Additional
information about the debugger can be found in <I>Don't Panic</I>, and
by typing <TT>?</TT> in the debugger.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00041000000000000000">The debugger</A></H2>
<P>
Use the Edwin <TT>M-x load-problem-set</TT> command to again load the
code for problem set 1 (and ignore the graphics display windows).
This will load definitions of the following three procedures <TT>p1</TT>,
<TT>p2</TT> and <TT>p3</TT>:
<P>

<PRE>(define p1
  (lambda (x y)
    (+ (p2 x y) (p3 x y))))

(define p2
  (lambda (z w) (* z w)))

(define p3
  (lambda (a b) (+ (p2 a) (p2 b))))</PRE>

<P>
In the Scheme buffer, evaluate the expression <TT>(p1 1 2)</TT>.  This
should signal an error, with the message:
<P>

<PRE>;The procedure #[compound-procedure P2] has been called with 1 argument
;it requires exactly 2 arguments.
;Type D to debug error, Q to quit back to REP loop:</PRE>

<P>
Don't panic.  Beginners have a tendency, when they hit an error, to
quickly type <TT>Q</TT>, often without even reading the error message.
Then they stare at their code in the editor trying to see what the bug
is.  Indeed, the example here is simple enough so that you probably
can find the bug by just reading the code.  Instead, however, let's
see how Scheme can be coaxed into producing some helpful information
about the error.
<P>
First of all, there is the error message itself.  It tells you that
the error was caused by a procedure being called with one argument,
which is the wrong number of arguments for that procedure.
Unfortunately, the error message alone doesn't say where in the code
the error occurred.  In order to find out more, you need to use the
debugger.  To do this type <TT>D</TT> to start the debugger.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00042000000000000000">Using the debugger</A></H2>
<P>
The debugger allows you to grovel around examining pieces of the
execution in progress, in order to learn more about what may have
caused the error.  When you start the debugger, it will create a new
window showing two buffers.  The bottom buffer right now is empty, and
top buffer should look like this:
<P>

<PRE>     COMMANDS:   ? - Help   q - Quit Debugger   e - Environment browser
This is a debugger buffer:
Lines identify stack frames, most recent first.
   Sx means frame is in subproblem number x
   Ry means frame is reduction number y
The buffer below describes the current subproblem or reduction.
-----------
The *ERROR* that started the debugger is:
  The procedure #[compound-procedure 119 p2] has been called with 1 argument;
  it requires exactly 2 arguments.

&gt;S0  (#[compound-procedure 119 p2] 2)
    R0  (p2 b)
 S1  (p2 b)
    R0  (+ (p2 a) (p2 b))
    R1  (p3 x y)
 S2  (p3 x y)
    R0  (+ (p2 x y) (p3 x y))
    R1  (p1 1 2)
 --more--</PRE>

<P>
You can select a frame by clicking on it with the mouse or by using
the ordinary cursor line-motion commands to move from line to line.
Notice that the information bottom buffer changes as the selected line
changes.
<P>
The frames in the list in the top buffer represent the steps in the
evaluation of the expression.  There are two kinds of
steps--subproblems and reductions.  This idea will be discussed in
lecture on February 10.  For now, you should think of a reduction step
as transforming an expression into ``more elementary'' form, and think
of a subproblem as picking out a piece of a compound expression to
work on.
<P>
So, starting at the bottom of the list and working upwards, we see
<TT>(p1 1 2)</TT>, which is the expression we tried to evaluate.  The
next line up indicates that <TT>(p1 1 2)</TT> reduces to <TT>(+
(p2 x y) (p3 x y))</TT>.  Above that, we see that in order to evaluate
this expression the interpreter chose to work on the subproblem <TT>
(p3 x y)</TT>, and so on, moving upwards until we reach the error: the
call to <TT>(p2 b)</TT> from within the procedure <TT>p3</TT> has only one
argument, and <TT>p2</TT> requires two arguments.<A NAME="tex2html11" HREF="footnode.html#414"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://swissnet.ai.mit.edu/latex2html-lib/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A>
<P>
Take a moment to examine the other debugger information (which will
come in handy as your programs become more complex).  Specifically, in
the top buffer, select the line

<PRE>&gt;S2  (p3 x y)</PRE>

<P>
The bottom buffer should now look like this: 

<PRE>                         SUBPROBLEM LEVEL: 2
Expression (from stack):
 Subproblem being executed highlighted.
    (+ (p2 x y) (p3 x y))
---------------------------------------------------------------------
ENVIRONMENT named: (student)
    has 79 bindings

==&gt; ENVIRONMENT created by the procedure: P1
      x = 1
      y = 2
---------------------------------------------------------------------
;EVALUATION may occur below in the environment of the selected frame.</PRE>

<P>
The information here is in three parts.  The first shows the
expression again, with the subproblem being worked on highlighted.
The next major part of the display shows information about the <I>
environments</I>.  We'll have a lot more to say about environments later
in the semester, but for now notice the line

<PRE>==&gt; ENVIRONMENT created by the procedure: P1</PRE>

<P>
This indicates that the evaluation of the current expression is
within procedure <TT>p1</TT>.  Also we find the environment has two <I>
bindings</I> that specify the particular values of <TT>x</TT> and <TT>y</TT>
referred to in the expression, namely <TT>x = 1</TT> and <TT>y = 2</TT>.  At
the bottom of the description buffer is an area where you can evaluate
expressions in this environment (which is often useful in debugging).
For example, try evaluating <TT>(+ x y)</TT>, and notice that you can do
this, even though these values of <TT>x</TT> and <TT>y</TT> are local to
this activation of <TT>P1</TT>.
<P>
Before quitting the debugger try one final experiment (you may have
already done this).  Continue to scroll down through the stack past
the line: <TT>R1 (p1 1 2)</TT> (you can also click the mouse on the line
<TT>-more-</TT> to show the next subproblem).  You will then see
additional frames that contain various bits of compiled code.  What
you are looking at is some of the guts of the Scheme system--the part
shown here is a piece of the interpreter's read-eval-print program.
In general, backing up from any error will eventually land you in the
guts of the system. (Yes: almost all of the system is itself a Scheme
program.)
<P>
You can type <TT>q</TT> to return to the Scheme top level interpreter.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SECTION00042010000000000000">Experiment 1:  More debugging</A></H4>
<P>
The code you loaded for problem set 1 also defined three other
procedures, called <TT>fold</TT>, <TT>spindle</TT>, and <TT>mutilate</TT>.  One
of these procedures contains an error.  Evaluate the expression <TT>
(fold 1 2)</TT>.  What is the error?  How should the procedure be defined?
Notice that you can examine the code for a procedure by using the
<TT>pp</TT> command.  For example, evaluating the expression <TT>(pp
fold)</TT> will print the definition of <TT>fold</TT>.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SECTION00042020000000000000">Experiment 2: Still more debugging</A></H4>
<P>
The code you loaded also contains a buggy definition of a procedure
meant to compute the factorials of positive integers:
<IMG WIDTH=258 HEIGHT=26 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline879" SRC="img15.gif">.  Evaluate the
expression <TT>(fact 5)</TT> (which is supposed to return 120).  Use the
debugger to find the bug, and correct the definition.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00043000000000000000">The stepper</A></H2>
<P>
The stepper is another useful debugging tool that you should become
acquainted with.  Go into the Scheme buffer and type the expression
<TT>(+ (* 3 4) (* 5 6))</TT>, but
instead of evaluating it with <TT>c-X c-E</TT>, type <TT>M-s</TT>.  The
screen will split to show two windows.  The top is your Scheme buffer;
the bottom is the <EM>Stepper buffer</EM>, which right now should read,

<PRE>(+ (* 3 4) (* 5 6)) =&gt; ;waiting</PRE>

``Waiting'' means that it's waiting for you to tell it to go on, which
you do by pressing the space bar.  You'll see Scheme start to work on
the subexpression <TT>(* 5 6)</TT>.  Continuing to press the space bar
will show each element in the evaluation.  The various ``waiting''
tokens will be replaced by the values as the evaluation proceeds.  At
the end, you should be up at the top of the window again, with 42
shown as the value of the call to the stepper.  At this point, you can
get out of the stepper by moving back to the Scheme buffer.
<P>
Try stepping this same expression a few times until you see clearly
what is going on.  Rather than always hitting the space bar, there are
a couple of other stepper commands you can try (press <TT>?</TT> to see
them listed):
<UL>
<LI> <TT>o</TT> -- step over the current expression:  Get
the value of the current expression without stepping
through the details.
<LI> <TT>c</TT> -- contract:  After you've stepped through an
expression, hide the details, showing only the result.
<LI> <TT>e</TT> -- expand: Undo the contraction.
</UL>
<P>
One more experiment: Try stepping through the evaluation of <TT>(p1 1
2)</TT>, which is the expression you used above to learn about the
debugger.  You will find that when you get to the evaluation of the
expression that produces the error, you'll see <TT>
#[unspecified-return-value]</TT> as the result--this should give you a
hint that something has gone wrong.
<P>
In general, you use the debugger and stepper to home in on bugs from
two different ``directions.''  If you have a program that signals an
error, you can just let the error occur and use the debugger to try to
figure out what happened; or you can step through the program up to
the point where you see the error happen and try to figure out what is
causing it.
<P>
Debugging can be frustrating.  The debugging tools are your friends.
Call on them regularly.  People often wish that they never encountered
bugs, and you'll sometimes hear ``theorists'' of computer
science teaching to claim that if you plan your programs well, you
won't have bugs.  We wonder if these ``theorists'' have ever written
any programs:
